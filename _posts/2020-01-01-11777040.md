In the dystopian South Korea, Jun Seok gets out of prison for a previous heist he and his friends had messed up, and the currency (the Korean won) has crashed massively, making the haul of their last job effectively worthless. Jun Seok proposes one last heist to his best friends Jang Ho and Ki Hoon, in order for the trio to escape from their miserable situations. Their target is an illegal gambling house, which stores hefty stacks of US dollars. The trio recruits Sang Soo, who currently works in the gambling house. After getting firearms from Bong Shik, a friend Jun Seok knew in prison, the quartet proceeds with the heist, which finishes messy but successful. They take a large sum of cash and the gambling house's surveillance hard drives, which contain footage of shady dealings between the gambling house's owners and various criminals. The loss of the surveillance hard drives made the gambling house's owners unhappy. They recruit killer Han to track the quartet and retrieve the hard drives.::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_Hunt_(film)

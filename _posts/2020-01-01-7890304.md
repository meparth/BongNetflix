Three very different young men - Dong Goo, the bad luck incarnate who dreams of becoming a film director, Joon Ki, an eccentric actor who performs to make a living, and Doo Shik, a freelancer writer who fiddles around doing nothing most of the time - open a guest house named "Waikiki" in Itaewon where many foreigners come to stay.

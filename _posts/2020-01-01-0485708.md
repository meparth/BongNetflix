The inimitable Whiffles learns that he bears a close resemblance, in fact, is a double to the newly appointed Secretary of Aviation, and being curious, he goes to the secretary's home. When the latter comes out, Whiffles goes in and his face being the double of the secretary's, he is admitted without question to the private office. Here he discovers that the secretary has two appointments, one at three o'clock with the Ambassador of Hoboken and one at four o'clock with the secretary's sweetheart. When the ambassador calls, he and Whiffles exchange notes of doubtful courtesy through the medium of the butler and the ambassador departs in high dudgeon. Successful in this, Whiffles decides to call on the secretary's sweetheart and gets away with it until the secretary himself arrives.::Moving Picture World synopsis

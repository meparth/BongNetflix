Disillusioned with the progress she and her husband hoped to see in Mexico has seeped into Emillia's marriage to the President and she has decided to divorce him. But on the night she was set to leave, she has a violent argument with Diego (her husband) and he falls off the balcony onto the top of a car. An autopsy reveals that a bullet to the head killed the President, not the fall and Emillia is on the run until she can prove not only that she did not kill her husband, but the identity of the murderer. To do this, she will need help from the very people who were hurt the most by government policies.::Pam Adams

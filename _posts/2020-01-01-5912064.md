The Kims are first generation Korean-Canadians who operate a convenience store in inner city Toronto. They like to believe that they are modern and have fully integrated into Canadian life, which isn't totally how others probably view them, believing they having a more traditional Korean sensibility. Among those that view them this way are most of their customers and their two Canadian born offspring, young adults Jung and Janet. Jung actually left home at age sixteen in an argument with "Appa" (Korean for father), and entered into a life of juvenile delinquency. Jung, who has not been home since, is now trying to make a better life for himself. What Appa does not know is that Jung actually lives and works in the neighborhood, and that "Umma" (Korean for mother) and Janet have kept in touch with him over this entire time in the hope that he and Appa will sometime reconcile. With Jung not at home, Janet has felt over-parented. While Appa and Umma pay for her art college schooling in her want to be a photographer, they really just want her to marry a nice, Christian, Korean boyfriend, and for her and her future husband to take over running the store.::Huggo

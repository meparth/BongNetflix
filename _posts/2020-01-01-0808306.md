Wearing rather thick prescription eye-glasses, Aspi lives in the Dadar Parsi Colony, and is terrified of going to school as he gets picked on. He assists another beleaguered student, Zara, and after being hit by Hailey's comet, their respective visions improve so much that they discard their eye-glasses, become friends, grow up and get married. After Oscar's wife kills herself, leaving him to look after his daughter, Gina and son, Ricky, he gets married to Nahid, his business partner's wife, after he and their two daughters die in an accident. Gujarati-speaking Shilpa is forced to get married to Hitesh while she is in love with a poor youth, Jignesh. Punjabi-speaking, Chandigarh-born, talkative Pinky's dreams come true when she gets to marry her sweetheart, Delhi-born, Vicky Kapoor. Bengali-speaking conservative Partho Sen gets married to a seemingly coy, Milly. Non-resident Indian, Bunty, gets married to Madhu, who he met via the Internet, after Madhu finds that her lover of many years, Sanjay Bapat, is not only already married but also has a child. The lives of these five couples interline during their honeymoon bus trip to Goa, and this is where secrets will be revealed, exposing the lack of compatibility as well as a dark side that they had never known of their respective spouses.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

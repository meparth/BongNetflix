In the aftermath of high school student Charlie Grimille's untimely death and the freakish accident that occurred during the 1993 play, "The Gallows", Nebraska's Beatrice Drama Club attempts to stage the very same play again. However, after two long decades of grief, re-enacting the cursed play that claimed Charlie's life doesn't seem like a good idea, especially when the untalented protagonist, Reese Houser, gets a bad case of the jitters only hours before the opening night. To save himself the embarrassment, Reese decides to take matters into his own hands with the aid of two of his friends; instead, they find themselves trapped in the ill-lit auditorium, where a malevolent supernatural entity seems to be at work. Now, the noose is tightening around everyone involved. Is there an escape from the gallows?::Nick Riganas

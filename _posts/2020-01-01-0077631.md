During a visit to America, Australian Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) meets Danny Zuko (John Travolta) at the beach and falls in love. She is heartbroken when summer ends and she has to return home and their last kiss on the beach is a very emotional one. But fate lends a hand - her parents decide to stay in America and she finds herself attending the same school as Danny. But Danny at school is different from Danny at the beach. He is the leader of the T-Birds, a black leather-clad gang, and has a reputation to keep up. He can't be seen to fall in love with just one chick. Sandy is upset and seeks solace with some new friends she has made - a girls' club called "The Pink Ladies". But her prim and proper virginal ways do not fit in and she soon finds herself almost alone. A change must be made. Does she attempt to get her man by turning him into a jock? Or must she get rid of her "Sandra Dee" image?::Rhino <rhino@blueyonder.co.uk>

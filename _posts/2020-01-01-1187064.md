In high hopes of blowing off steam, the waitress and single mother, Jess, decides to go on a sailboat trip with friends. However, before long, a nightmarish storm is brewing--and just like that--their luxurious yacht is soon capsized by a massive wave. Now, helpless in the middle of the unforgiving ocean, Jess and the rest of the survivors board an eerily abandoned cruise ship, only to realise that they are trapped in the vessel's maze-like corridors. More and more, as Jess experiences increasingly chilling incidents of déjà-vu, the feeling that they are being chased down by an invisible killer becomes a horrific reality. Is there an escape from madness?::Nick Riganas

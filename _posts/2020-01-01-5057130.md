Florence, 1469. An attempt on Piero de Medici's life forces his son Lorenzo (called The Magnificent) to assume leadership of the family's banking dynasty. Once in power, young Lorenzo resolves to do things differently. With his brother Giuliano and young artist Sandro Botticelli at his side, he abandons the cynical politics of the past to usher in a new era of creative and political revolution. This swiftly brings him into conflict with the head of Florence's other powerful banking family, Jacopo Pazzi, who will stop at nothing to defeat Lorenzo. Their clash gives rise to one of the most thrilling political intrigues in history, the infamous Pazzi conspiracy.

Director: `Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell`  

Cast: `Bob Lazar` `George Knapp` `Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell` `Mickey Rourke` `Joy White` 

Former government physicist Bob Lazar made headlines world-wide in 1989 when he came forward with his account of reverse-engineering an alien spacecraft for the US military. The reason the public even knows the name Area 51 is because Lazar came forward about the work he did at the formerly secret military base. His testimony remains the most controversial and important UFO story of all time. This film intimately chronicles the challenges and travails of a cosmic whistleblower. Burdened with a revolutionary secret, he had to choose between his oath to his country or his conscience. Corbell's film explores Lazar's groundbreaking claims and the devastating impact it has had on his life over the course of the last 30 years, including rare and never before revealed footage guaranteed to alter the landscape of the debate. He blew the whistle, shocked the world, then went silent - until now.::Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell

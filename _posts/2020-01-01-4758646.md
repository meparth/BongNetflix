Director: `David Mich√¥d`  

Cast: `Brad Pitt` `Daniel Betts` `John Magaro` `Emory Cohen` `RJ Cyler` 

A general with prior experience is sent to Afghanistan with a mission shrouded in vagueness, nonexistent political support and a lack of confidence from the U.S. government. However, with the team of supporters and aides that surround him, a strategic "battle" plan is set into motion that is questionable by those who already believe there is no hope, and flawless by those that are closest to him.

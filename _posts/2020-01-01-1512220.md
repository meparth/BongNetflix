Born in Goa, naive Michael Pinto lives a middle-classed lifestyle with his widowed mother, and has a mentor in Father Simon. He uses snail mail to stay in touch with a former friend, Mumbai-based Sameer Sharma, who refuses to acknowledge nor communicate with him. When his mother unexpectedly passes away, Simon counsels him to re-locate to Mumbai and find a career with the help of Sameer. Simon accordingly contacts the latter and asks that he receive Michael at the airport. Sameer, who has employment pressures, as well as an ambitious wife, Suhani, who is all set to being promoted as Creative Director, is not too thrilled about the entry of Michael in his complicated life. An unknowing Michael has no clue that soon he is in store for a life-changing experience and will be involved with an assorted group of people - including gun-toting gangsters, kidnappers, a Caucasian female named Maggie, an alcoholic movie star, Reshma Shergill - and a roller-coaster ride, in bizarre and strange surroundings.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

During the coordinated Western Allied invasion of Nazi Germany in the spring of 1945, and with Adolf Hitler bracing up for a last stand, the battle-scarred U.S. Army Sargent of the 2nd Armoured Division, Don "Wardaddy" Collier, and his loyal crew of a powerful M4 Sherman tank, fight tooth and nail against a desperate enemy. War is hell for all men, let alone Collier's inexperienced new hull machine gunner, Norman, who must quickly get into shape if he wants to have a fighting chance deep behind the enemy lines. On the victorious 76mm cannon barrel of the voracious war machine, the men have painted "Fury" in bold white paint to banish the horrors of war. Will the Fury's five-man crew live to fight another day?::Nick Riganas

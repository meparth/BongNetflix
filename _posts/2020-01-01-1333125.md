Struggling screenwriter Charlie Wessler has managed to get a pitch meeting with studio executive Griffin Schraeder. The many ideas Charlie pitches, each with a shocking twist, include: a woman unable to contain her horror at the unaddressed obvious physical issue with a blind date, one of the most eligible bachelors in town; parents who do whatever needed to make sure their home-schooled teenaged son's academic experience is as typical as possible; a man's efforts to accommodate an "if you love me" request from his fianc√©e; a young couple's troubled relationship played out, unknown to them, on the loudspeaker of his workplace, a big box retailer; a corporate managers' meeting to discuss a design flaw with their latest release, the iBabe; Robin, of Batman & Robin, trying to speed date without the interference of his much higher profile partner; two middle-schoolers, on a date at his house, when she experiences her first period in a testosterone-laden environment; the issues around a birthday gift a guy gives to his male roommate; a couple on a blind date who decide to get to the crux of their beings by playing truth or dare; a basketball coach using the "black" elephant in the room to spur on his players; and a woman's relationship with her boyfriend's animated cat, Beezel, and Beezel's fantasy relationship with the boyfriend. As the meeting progresses, Griffin comes to an obvious conclusion about the ideas while also coming to a revelation about the genesis of the meeting itself. He has to figure out how to handle dealing with Charlie in light of these issues and Charlie's reaction to Griffin figuring things out.::Huggo

Ramakant Joshi, Lambodar Jha and Akshay Kumar are residents in the 'C' block of a Mumbai Apartment complex with monetary issues. They decide to create a fake organization 'C Company' in order to extort 1 Crore Rupees from Ramakant's son, Purshottam. While Ramakant hopes to recover the costs involved in his ungrateful son's upbringing; vertically-challenged Lambodar, who is the same height as his school-going son, hopes to boost his career; while Akshay hopes to elope with a gangster's daughter, Priya, to Dubai. Things hilariously get out of hand after the trio decide to assist other beleaguered Indians - putting themselves in the bad books of the Government; the Police, including 'encounter specialist' Inspector Jawle; as well as the underworld led by a Balaji TV-serial addict, Dattubhai.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

In near future, a group of international scientists was sent from Earth to explore unknown Mars at International Space Station (ISS). They got a soil sample from Mars which contained a sleeping cell. After a series of attempts they woke up such cell and it was growing bigger day by day. During an experiment the living thing attacked scientists and escaped from the highly sealed laboratory through an internal air vent. Those horrified scientists, on the one side they needed to protect themselves from being killed by this deadliest creature, on the other side they needed to terminate it before it was too late. However, this smart alien would do anything to survive.::Hongkonger

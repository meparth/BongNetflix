Against all logic and the laws of nature, an unprecedented hurricane off the coast of Mexico rips out a ravenous shiver of sharks, making its way towards southern California. As the freakish meteorological phenomenon brings violent tempests and towering, shark-infested tidal waves, the former surfing champion and Santa Monica Pier bar-owner, Finley "Fin" Shepard, embarks on a peril-laden journey to Beverly Hills, fearing for the life of his estranged wife, April, and his teenage daughter, Candice. Now, Fin; his friend, Baz; barmaid, Nova, and his regular customer, George, must fight tooth and nail to stay alive, as batch after batch of the flying oceanic predators rains down on the unsuspecting Angelenos, gobbling down everything in their path. Who can stand in the way of the mighty Sharknado?::Nick Riganas

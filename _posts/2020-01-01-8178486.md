Lucy is a buttoned-up, MUJI-clad translator who has been in Japan for five years and is desperate to blend in. Her reticent nature hides old scars. There's also the fact that people around her keep dying - accidentally or otherwise. After a street encounter with hot photographer Teiji, she quickly finds herself under his spell, despite all the warning signs. And the pot is stirred further when American nurse Lily - all blowzy sexual confidence and cultural naivety - arrives in town and Lucy experiences some frightening impulses.::London Film Festival

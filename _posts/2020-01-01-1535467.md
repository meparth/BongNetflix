Gurtej Singh Kahlon witnesses his family being attacked by British-born Caucasian skinheads, leading to a death in the family. While the identified attackers were never charged by racially biased police, he himself was arrested for defending his family. He swore to change the manner in which East Indians were profiled and set about to build a Mini-India in Southall. He encourages his son, Parghat, to play and excel in cricket as he himself was a fan of the Indian team, especially Lala and his son, Mohinder Ambarnath. But when the time comes for Parghat to be inducted in the English cricket team, he forbids him, gets him to manage a convenience store, and also sets about to arrange marriages and lives of his family with no daring to oppose him. Then mixed-raced Simran Chaggal enters Parghat's life, and with some help from the Kahlon family, gets him to be included in a failing English team. They conspire to keep this information from Gurtej, and even re-name Parghat as 'Kaali'. But it will not be long before Gurtej finds out, collapses, is hospitalized, refuses to have to do anything with his son, and even refers to him as 'Angrez Chamcha'. Shameful of having hurt his father, and no one in the family to back him up, Parghat has no option but to publicly announce his 'retirement' from cricket.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

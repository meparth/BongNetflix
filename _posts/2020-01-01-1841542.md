When an employee of Mumbai's Chandan Nagar leaves, he is replaced by a youth, Fatka, who has a stray dog, Bhidu (a.k.a. Buddy). There is no accommodation provided for this homeless orphan, so he and his pet decide to make an abandoned antique car their new home. There is some resentment from the children of the building, but Fatka gets accepted in the cricket team after he demonstrates his bowling capabilities. A chance visit by a politician, Shashikant Bhide, results in enforcement of new municipal legislation to capture all stray dogs, and the children decide to oppose it. Their attempt to secure 31 signatures from residents turns out to be in vain, and they decide to launch a unique protest. Shashikant puts pressure on Chandan Nagar's Secretary, Tandon, as well as launches his own campaign to enforce the legislation and ensure Bhidu's capture.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

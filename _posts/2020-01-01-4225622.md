Cole, an introverted 12-year-old boy who is always bullied by his next-door neighbour, is secretly having a crush on his gorgeous babysitter, Bee. With this in mind, even though Cole doesn't admit it, he still needs his babysitter, as Bee is, above all, every boy's dream-girl fantasy incarnate. However, when Cole's parents leave for the weekend, unforeseen revelations regarding Bee's obscure past, will force the young teenager to take matters into his own hands, and for the first time in his life, overcome his fears to become the neighbourhood's hero. Of course, all that's needed is just a splash of blood.::Nick Riganas

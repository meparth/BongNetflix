Director: `Eric Darnell` `Tom McGrath`  

Cast: `Ben Stiller` `Chris Rock` `David Schwimmer` `Jada Pinkett Smith` `Sacha Baron Cohen` 

Desperate to return to their beloved Central Park Zoo, the tame quartet of New Yorkers--Alex, the self-absorbed lion; Marty, the optimistic zebra; Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe, and Gloria, the curvaceous hippo--embark on a decrepit cargo aeroplane along with some new friends. However, this time, the team crash-lands at the flat plains of the boundless African savannah, marooned at a special and all-too-familiar place where the memories overflow and everyone gets the chance to broaden his horizons. Will an escape to Africa help Alex rediscover his origins?::Nick Riganas

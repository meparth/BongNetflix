Cast: `Emily Blunt` `John Krasinski` `Millicent Simmonds` `Noah Jupe` `Cade Woodward` 

On a devastated Earth overrun by lethal and ever-hearing predators of a possible extraterrestrial origin, the Abbotts struggle to survive in a desolate New York City in a new era of utter silence. As this new type of invader is attracted to noise, even the slightest of sounds can be deadly; however, it's been already twelve months since the powerful monsters' first sightings, and this resilient family still stands strong. To learn the rules of survival in this muted dystopia is essential; nevertheless, an otherwise joyous event is threatening an already frail stability. Now, more than ever, don't make a sound.::Nick Riganas

In search of brave and faithful supporters to join the Knights of the Round Table, the legendary British leader, King Arthur of Camelot, rides around Britain's countryside atop his noble steed. Before long, a handful of good men answer his call; however, after careful consideration, they decide to go their separate ways, only to provoke the wrath of the omnipotent being in the clouds, who commands Arthur and his followers to find the fabled Holy Grail. Now, on a mission from God himself, five men must brave taunting French soldiers; confront sexually obsessed virgins; do battle with the notorious Black Knight; face a mysterious enchanter named "Tim", and slay a vicious furry protector. But, are King Arthur's knights up to the task?::Nick Riganas

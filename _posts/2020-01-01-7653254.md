Director: `Noah Baumbach`  

Cast: `Adam Driver` `Scarlett Johansson` `Julia Greer` `Azhy Robertson` `Wallace Shawn` 

Sadly, after numerous disastrous sessions of marital mediation, New York City's brilliant theatre director, Charlie, and the one-time Los Angeles movie actress, Nicole, decided to split up, putting an end to their decade-long marriage. However, divorce is horrible--and as the once-close-knit couple struggles to make it work for the sake of their eight-year-old son, Henry--vitriolic accusations and bitter resentment threaten the very foundation of Charlie and Nicole's so-called amicable separation. Now, shrewd and absurdly costly lawyers take over, and things are bound to get messy. But, why are love's wounds so deep, and cruelly painful? In the end, is love always forever?::Nick Riganas

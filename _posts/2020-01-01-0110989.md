Born into inexhaustible wealth, the heir to billions, Richard "Richie" Rich Jr., can only dream of having a normal life with real friends his age to play with. However, everything is about to change, when a sinister scheme--devised by someone who yearns to take over the lucrative business empire--maroons Richie's doting parents in the middle of the ocean, leaving him all alone to save the corporation from the clutches of scheming executives and their dangerous henchmen. Now, Richie--along with his loyal valet, Herbert Cadbury, and a young team of unexpected allies--must find the whereabouts of his lost parents, while, in the meantime, try to run his father's company. Can the world's richest kid save the day?::Nick Riganas

In search of the perfect Christmas present for Billy, his teenage son, Randall Peltzer comes up with a "Mogwai". But, this otherwise sweet and furry pet companion comes with a warning: should its unwise owner break the three fundamental guidelines of owning such a unique creature, all hell will break loose. Of course, Billy disregards the strict rules, and as the once-adorable animal spawns terrifying minuscule critters, the suburban haven of Kingston Falls is under siege. Now, there is no turning back, and destruction is at hand. Is there an escape from this endless Yuletide nightmare, and the horrible menace of the Gremlins?::Nick Riganas

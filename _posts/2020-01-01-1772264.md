In hope of becoming a resident and in search of experience, Edward Newgate, a promising young doctor who has recently graduated from Oxford, arrives at the Stonehearst institution for the mentally ill, in 1899. However, right from the start, it is quite clear that the superintendent Dr. Silas Lamb's unorthodox methods of treatment seem to have no positive effect on the patients, furthermore, there is a strange feeling that there is more to the asylum than meets the eye. Little by little, as Edward becomes infatuated with the mysteriously alluring inmate, Eliza Graves, reconciling Lamb's practices with his fresh ideas about therapy, will soon lead to a startling and unexpected discovery.

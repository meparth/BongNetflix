Before he crossed paths with The Rebellion, Han Solo was a former Imperial Militant who became a space pirate cruising around the Outer Rim alongside his fellow outlaw: the mighty Wookiee, Chewbacca. This is the story of how he came to be known as the galaxy's most notorious smuggler, and how the man became a legend.::Johnny

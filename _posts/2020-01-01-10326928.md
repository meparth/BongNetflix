Kat Decker could really use a Christmas miracle. The aspiring singer-songwriter may have big dreams, but she has even bigger problems. Treated like a servant by her vain stepmother and self-involved stepsisters, Kat is forced into a demoralizing job as a singing elf at billionaire Terrence Wintergarden's Santa Land. But there is one bright spot to the job: Nick, the handsome new Santa at the tree lot and charms his way into her heart. When Kat gets invited to the prestigious Wintergarden Christmas Gala, her step-family is determined to prevent her from attending and snag their own invitation. Could an attentive dog, a loyal BFF and a sprinkling of holiday magic help turn things around for Kat? Join Laura Marano (Disney's Austin and Ally), Gregg Sulkin (Marvel's Runaways) and Isabella Gomez (One Day at a Time) in this modern-day re-imagining of the cherished classic, featuring original music and holiday favorites.

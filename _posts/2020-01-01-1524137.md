In New Orleans, the former smuggler Chris Faraday has regenerated and raised a family of his own with his wife Kate and their two children. Chris works in installation of alarms and his father is locked in prison for smuggling. When his brother-in-law Andy dumps in the sea water 10 pounds of cocaine that he is smuggling for the drug lord Tim Briggs to escape from the custom officers, Chris is forced to pay Andy's debts to protect the youngster and his own family. Chris leaves his wife and children under the protection of his best friend Sebastian Abney and travels in a Container Carrier to Panama to bring counterfeit bills and raise the money to pay Briggs. But Briggs and his partner want to force Chris to smuggle drugs and will use his family to reach their objective. Meanwhile Chris is betrayed and gets in trouble in Panama.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

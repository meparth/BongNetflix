After another operation breaking the protocol, CIA Director Alan Hunley decides to shutdown the IMF. Ethan Hunt is trying to prove the existence of the evil organization The Syndicate but he captured by his agents. However he succeeds to escape with the help of mysterious Syndicate agent Ilsa Faust. Trapped in London, Ethan requests support from William Brandt that tells him that can not do anything to help him since the IMF does not exist anymore. The lonely Ethan decides to follow his only lead, the rogue Syndicate agent Lane. A couple of months later, Ethan summons his friend and former colleague Benji Dunn to go to Austria to help him since he believes the Syndicate will try to assassin the Austrian Chancellor during the opera Turandot. Ethan saves the Chancellor from three snipers but he is killed by a bomb in his car. One of the snipers is Ilsa that gives a lead of Lane's scheme to Ethan. Who is the agent Ilsa Faust? Will Ethan be capable to prove that the Syndicate does exist?::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Untamed is a fantasy story set in ancient China about two young paladins who are completely opposite in character. In flashbacks we see them as antagonistic class mates. One is a charming bad boy who can't abide by the rules. The other is the serene and shining example of wuxia manhood. Their relationship is marked by teasing and annoying incidents untill they find themselves entangled in a bloody power struggle between the clans. They stick together untill bad boy becomes an infamous demonologist, and he gets hunted down by all clans. The 'good one' is forced to get in line with his clan, unable to save his friend from a tragical death. For mysterious reasons the bad boy returns 16 years later, apparently unharmed. They reunite, joining forces to solve the mystery behind the evil events in their past. Both discover that people aren't always what they seem, including themselves.

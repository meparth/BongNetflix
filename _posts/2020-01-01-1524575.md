In Los Angeles, Angela Holmes is a happy young woman, pride and joy of her father Colonel Roger Holmes and in love with her boyfriend Peter "Pete" Smith. On her birthday party, she cuts her hand and Roger and Peter take her to the hospital. When she returns home, she has a seizure and they drive her back to the hospital. Then Angela is discharged but she pulls the wheel of the taxi causing a serious accident. She returns in coma to the hospital. Forty days later, she has no response and Father Oscar Lozano convinces Roger to unplug the life support system. Out of the blue, she awakes in perfect health. Soon Angela shows signs of demoniac possession and the Vatican sends Cardinal Bruun to perform an exorcism to save her soul. Will there be time to save her body?::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

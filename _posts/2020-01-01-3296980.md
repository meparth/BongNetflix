Herbert lived well from his giant body for years, as a boxer since the GDR, nicknamed 'Pride of Leipzig', and now as bouncer and debt collector, while training promising boxers, especially gentle Eddy, who got a shot at the title in a much lower weight class. After ignoring symptoms for months, collapsing Herbert is diagnosed with the incurable muscular disease ALS, and is bluntly dropped from all his jobs and the gym. Seeking to set straight what went wrong is his life, he mends as good as he can with his daughter -neglected since age six- and deals with girl friend Marlene. Herbert is lucky with great home assistant Steffen, even gets to cheer protege Eddy to his title as last sportive achievement.::KGF Vissers

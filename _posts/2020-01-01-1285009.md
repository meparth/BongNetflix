Ten painful years of intimidation and slaughter have passed since the terrifying incident at the Hoyts' home in The Strangers (2008), and the mysterious masked psychopaths--Doll-face, Pin-Up Girl, and The Man in the Mask--have now picked out their next victims. As Mike, his wife, Cindy, and their children, Luke and Kinsey, head to Lake Gatlin to spend the night with Uncle Marvin, while on their way to Kinsey's faraway boarding school, the pitiless Strangers show up on their front door, intent on murder. Once more, an endless night of terror begins, and yet another family must fight tooth and nail to prevail. In this frenzied battle of survival, who shall live and who shall die?::Nick Riganas

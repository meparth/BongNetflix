Rocco Siffredi is to pornography what Mike Tyson is to boxing or Mick Jagger is to rock'n'roll: a living legend. His mother wanted him to be a priest; with her blessing he became a hardcore performer, devoting his life to one God only: Desire. Rocco Siffredi reveals all, even if it sometimes means busting his own myth: his true story, beginnings, career, wife and children... and the ultimate revelation that will change his life forever. A behind-the-scenes account of the porn world and its stars as they've never been seen before - the no-holds-bard portrait of a true giant.

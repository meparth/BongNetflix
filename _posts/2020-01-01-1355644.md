During a long, 120-year journey to the far-off planet, Homestead II, the state-of-the-art spaceship, Avalon, encounters an unusual malfunction. With the lives of more than 5,000 cryogenically frozen passengers hanging by a thread, the unfortunate mechanic, Jim Preston, finds himself prematurely awoken, ninety slow years before reaching the final destination. Now, as insufferable isolation, dreadful loneliness, and profound despair set in, uncomfortable thoughts give rise to a cruel and equally troubling dilemma. Will Jim ever set foot on the promised land?::Nick Riganas

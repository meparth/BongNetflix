The story of Sense8 begins when the psychic connection of eight strangers from different cultures and parts of the world is "birthed" by a woman called Angelica, who kills herself to avoid capture by a man named "Whispers". The eight eventually discover they now form a cluster of "sensates": human beings who are mentally and emotionally linked, can sense and communicate with each other, and can share their knowledge, language, and skills. In the first season, the eight-Capheus, Sun, Nomi, Kala, Riley, Wolfgang, Lito and Will-are shown trying both to live their everyday lives and to figure how and why they are connected. Meanwhile, a sensate named Jonas, who was involved with Angelica, comes to their aid, while the Biologic Preservation Organization (BPO) and Whispers, a high-ranking sensate inside BPO, attempt to hunt them down. In the second season, the eight have grown accustomed to their connection and help each other on a daily basis. They learn more about Homo sensorium (the scientific name of sensates), the history and goals of BPO, the role of Angelica in it, and their powers and how to temporarily suspend them. They also meet other sensates, not all of whom are friendly. At the same time, Jonas attempts to both aid them and look after himself after being captured by Whispers, who is now involved in a cat-and-mouse game with Will, each of them trying to outsmart the other.::ahmetkozan

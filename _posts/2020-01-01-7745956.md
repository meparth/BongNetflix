On the planet Etheria, Adora is an up and coming soldier for the Horde eager to defend her home from the menace of the Princesses she has been taught all her life to fear. Everything changes when a chance encounter with the mystic Sword of Protection in the Whispering Woods calls to her. Discovering to her horror the true evil of the Horde, Adora defects to the Rebellion as its foretold champion, She-Ra Princess of Power. Now, Adora and her new friends must rebuild the shattered Princess Alliance to defeat the Evil Horde.

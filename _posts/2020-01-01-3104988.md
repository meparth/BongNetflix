In 1995, the Young family arrive at a London hotel to check in, but are denied their reservation by racist staff. In response, they purchase the hotel, forcing the staff to give them their room. Forwarding to 2018, Rachel Chu, an economics professor at New York University, is eating at a cafe with her boyfriend Nick Young after teaching a lecture. She accepts an invitation to accompany him to Singapore for his best friend Colin and his fiancee Araminta's wedding. The day after arriving in Singapore, Rachel visits her college friend Peik Lin and her family, who are shocked when Rachel tells them that she is dating Nick Young. Peik Lin explains the history of Nick's family fortune and the fanfare surrounding Colin's wedding, warning Rachel that Nick's high-society family and friends will be overly critical of her, though Rachel is unconcerned. At a dinner party at Nick's family home, Nick introduces Rachel to his mother, Eleanor, while Nick's cousin Astrid discovers that her husband Michael has been having an affair. Rachel worries that Eleanor dislikes her, although she seems to make a good impression on Nick's grandmother, Su Yi.

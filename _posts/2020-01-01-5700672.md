The investment manager Seok-woo is a divorced man that lives in Seoul, with his daughter, Soo-an, and his mother. Seok-woo is a selfish man and neglects Soo-an, who misses her mother that lives in Busan. On Soo-an's birthday, she asks to visit her mother, and Seok-woo travels with her with the intention of returning after lunch. They board the fast train KTX, but a sick woman also boards another car. During the journey, the woman attacks a member of the train staff and soon all the passengers in the car are attacked, turning into zombies. Seok-woo realizes that there is a zombie outbreak in South Korea, and together with the passenger Sang-hwa, who is traveling with his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, they isolate the safe front cars from the infected ones. Along their journey, the non-infected passengers have to fight the zombies and the selfishness of their fellow human beings.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

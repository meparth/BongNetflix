Cast: `Jennifer Aniston` `Kevin Costner` `Shirley MacLaine` `Mark Ruffalo` `Richard Jenkins` 

Sarah Huttington, recently engaged, goes home to Pasadena with fiancé Jeff for a family wedding. She hears a rumor that "The Graduate" (book and movie) is based on her family. Did her grandmother and her mom have flings with the same man just before her parents married? Is she a strange man's child? Does this explain why she doesn't fit in? Was her mother happy? Is she also facing a loveless marriage? Where can she seek answers: her mother's dead, her father's a pleasant naïf. Ask her salty grandma? Better to ask the man in the triangle, the real Benjamin Braddock. With Jeff's blessing, Sarah heads for San Francisco, looking for the key to her past and to her future.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>

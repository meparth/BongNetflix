Cast: `Salman Khan` `Akshay Kumar` `Preity Zinta` `Anupam Kher` `Tom DiNardo` 

Good Shepherd College nerd, complete with eye-glasses and braces, Agastya Rao alias Champu, has a crush on Piya Goel, and is thrilled when she invites him to go to a dance, only to be heart-broken when he finds out that she really digs another guy. Years later, Agastya has graduated, re-located to the U.S. where he is an astronaut with NASA, and when he finds out that his college sweetheart is about to divorce her husband, decides to try his hand at wooing her. He gets the unsolicited help of one-time Bollywood wonder Suhaan Kapoor, who accompanies Agastya to New York, assists him in successfully wooing and proposing to Piya. On the night of their engagement, Agastya will find out that Suhaan only wanted to help him because of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act - so that could relieve him of the financial burden of paying alimony to Piya, who was the girl he had secretly married much against the wishes of the entire Goel clan. Watch what happens when Suhaan finds out that he has a daughter named Suhaani - and that he still has strong feelings about Piya.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

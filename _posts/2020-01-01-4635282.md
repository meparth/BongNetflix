The OA, Netflix new original series, concerns the apparently miraculous return of a young woman who had been missing for 7 years. When she originally disappeared, she was blind and now her sight has been somehow restored. Plus, now she has severe scarring on her back which, she either will not explain how she got the scars or she truly does not remember how the scarring happened. When she is first questioned, she not only does not remember her name but anyone she meets, at least at first. To some people she is a miracle and to others, she is dangerous. The truth is rarely simple or easy.::lscagle

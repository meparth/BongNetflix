Elissa and her mother Sarah move into a large house in a nice suburb. Sarah is recently divorced, has a new job and hopes to have a new beginning after her recent divorce. One of the reasons they can afford the house they've rented is that their neighbors, just down the end of the street, were killed there not long ago by their daughter Carrie Anne. The house is now occupied by the dead couple's son Ryan who had been raised by an elderly aunt and returned only after the tragedy. Ryan isn't well-liked and often has to face often angry neighbors who seem to be more worried about their property values than his well-being. Elissa takes a liking to him but is embarrassed by her mother's overprotective attitude. There are secrets and there is danger however.::garykmcd

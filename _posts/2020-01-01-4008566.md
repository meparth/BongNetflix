Alicia is a nurse who moves from the city to her natal little town of Duesos (municipality of Caravia, east to Principality of Asturias; northwest to Spain), in order to care Victoria, her aging and dying mother, connected to a life support machine to still breathing when she fell in a coma one month ago, after three years struggling with a terminal disease. Moving there with her unemployed husband Mikel and their daughter Nora, Alicia meets again with her younger sister Sara and she meets Ana, Victoria's nurse assistant. At the same time that Alicia tries to reconcile her present with a hard childhood due to the abusive and dominant Victoria, a witch turned crazy after the death of her husband (Alicia and Sara's father) and she blamed them by it, Mikel finds a job in the port town, and Nora meets a strange little girl, Luna, who bad behavior and attitude starts to affect her. Suspecting about her own mother despite the coma, the changes in Nora makes Alicia to think in an evil plot with Nora as objective after Victoria named her universal heiress in the will, and specially after to find Victoria's tools for practice witchcraft. Denied to die and looking for a different kind of immortality, Victoria's plan closes around her granddaughter, while Alicia starts a race against time to save Nora before it be too much late.::Chockys

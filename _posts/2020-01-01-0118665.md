Two scientists, Dr. Elena Kinder and Dr. Heep use genius baby studies to fund their Babyco theme park. At age two, the children are due to 'cross over', learn to talk, and forget their universal knowledge. One mischievous toddler, Sly, makes repeated attempts to escape the "Kinder" lab and one night, he actually succeeds. What Sly does not expect is to run into his twin, Whit, in a mall playground. Although Sly and Whit share a telepathic bond, they have no idea of each other's existence. When the guards from the lab capture Whit, mistaken him for Sly, and take him back to the Kinder lab, Sly is taken home by Whit's adopted mother, who has mistaken him for Whit.::Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}

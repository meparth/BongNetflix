Shocked by the death of a dear friend he finds out while reading the local newspaper, the now-late-thirty-something writer, Gordie Lachance, takes a trip down memory lane, when back in Oregon, in the hot summer of 1959, he and his three close friends, Chris, Teddy, and Vern, set out on a life-changing adventure. Back then, the news about the death of a missing twelve-year-old boy sparked their interest in following the train tracks, and become heroes by finding first his body. Unfortunately, so did the local tough, Ace Merrill, and his gang of bullies. Indeed, sometimes, growing up can be hard; nevertheless, finding real friends can be even harder. Will life be simpler if you stand by me?::Nick Riganas

Filmmaker and avid amateur cyclist Bryan Fogel decides to make a documentary on how easy it is to get away with doping in sport. He sets out to take illegal performance-enhancing substances, improve his cycling performance and show that the substances are undetectable. His task leads him to Grigory Rodchenkov, the head of the Russian anti-doping laboratory. Little does Fogel realise at the time but he is about to be involved in, and a chronicler of, sport's greatest ever doping scandal, as details are revealed of Russia's systemic, widespread, government-sponsored doping program.::grantss

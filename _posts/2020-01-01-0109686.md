Lloyd Christmas is a limo driver who's a few beers short of a six pack. His equally clueless roommate Harry Dunn is an operator for a mobile pet grooming service called "Mutt Cutts". One day Lloyd is assigned to pick up a wealthy customer for a ride to the airport. He believes this customer - named Mary Swanson - is the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. Little does Lloyd know that Mary is the victim of an elaborate kidnapping and extortion plot, and that the trip to the airport was supposed to be the payoff to release her kidnapped husband. Lloyd grabs the briefcase and that sets off a chain of events that see him and Harry going to Aspen, Colorado hell bent on delivering the briefcase to Mary. But along the way, they meet nearly every seedy and shady character involved in the conspiracy. But Lloyd doesn't know that the briefcase he's set on delivering to Mary contains nearly $5 million in cash. And his friendship with Harry is tested at every stop along the way, will they make it to Aspen and live the high life? Or face the wrath of the kidnappers and the FBI?::halo1k

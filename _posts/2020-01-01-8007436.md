¿How far does a soccer fan go for his beloved national team? Mariano Cárdenas (Adrian Uribe), a married man and a civil servant, shows us that crossing the line when supporting the national team is a must. Mexico and the USA are in the final qualifying match for the 2018 World Cup. Mariano is committed to giving everything he has, including his time and relationship with his wife, to be present in the game because he is convinced that his presence in the stadium is the only thing factor that will guarantee the victory. Everything is ready and organized for the big day. Unfortunately, plans change when Mariano learns of the death of his uncle, with whom he lived and with whom he wagered a large bet on the team. Mariano is torn between being at the funeral or escaping to accompany the team. Thanks to the decision he makes, he loses his job, his wife, his home but his heart is full as Mexico qualifies for the World Cup.

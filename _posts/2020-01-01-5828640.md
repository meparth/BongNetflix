In a not-so-distant future, global warming has melted the polar ice caps, flooding almost the entire surface of the Earth. With the globe submerged in water, the oceans' already undisputed apex predator, the mighty shark, has become the absolute ruler of the endless unified sea, forcing the remaining survivors to live in scattered floating towns, at their mercy. Now, the only hope to save the human race rests in the hands of a few scientists; however, they must first take down the mutated alpha-shark: the universal leader of the Earth's entire shark population. Can we reclaim our planet?::Nick Riganas

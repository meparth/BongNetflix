Young, beautiful, and intelligent Maya lives with her father in a palatial mansion in rural India. When her father suffers a stroke, she calls for the local Dr. Charu Das, who arrives on his bicycle and prescribes treatment for her dad. He comes often, more on the pretext of seeing her, than her dad, and eventually both get married. Years pass by, and Charu is busy engrossed in treating patients, leaving Maya alone to ponder her own fate and life. And it is not long before a young man named Rudra enters her life, and an affair follows. This affair does not last long, as a much younger man, Lalit, now enters Maya's life, and thence begins another passionate affair. But again, Maya is not satisfied. She longs for more than bodily needs, and it is perhaps this that leads to her sudden death, leaving two investigators to probe who or what really killed Maya.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

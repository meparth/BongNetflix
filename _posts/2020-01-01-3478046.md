Life is tough for Geyikli clarinetist Huseyin Badem after marrying his true love, Mujgan. He must grab every opportunity that comes his way to take care of his expanding family, even if it means playing clarinet by night for dingy clubs in the area. Meanwhile, his dear friend and "big sister" Firuzan is back in Istanbul to work on her singing career and becoming more famous by the day. But for Huseyin, Firuzan seems like a sweet memory from the past: a figure he misses and only gets to see on TV these days. Although they don't know it, both are about to go through the mill.::BKM

This movie, based on the television series, finds Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and his team charged with stopping a traitor from stealing and selling classified material. Everything was going well until the man they are following and all of the team are inexplicably killed except for Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Ethan then calls Director Kittridge (Henry Czerny) and goes to meet him when he discovers that the whole mission was to ferret a mole that they have been suspicious of for some time. Kittridge shows evidence that hints that Ethan's the one for whom they have been looking, but Ethan knows that he is not, so he escapes. Ethan then arranges to meet the buyer, whom he warns against using the material he has, and when they meet, he offers to get what he paid for in exchange for telling who the mole is. Ethan, along with Phelps' wife Claire (Emmanuelle Béart) recruits two disavowed Agents, Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), to help him, which won't be easy, it'll be nearly impossible.::rcs0411@yahoo.com

After authorities fail to bring any charges, Breacher starts retraining the group which has grown rusty and distrustful of each other during the long layoff. Soon, members of Breacher's crew start dying in gruesome fashion. He gets close to Caroline Brentwood (Olivia Williams) the investigator put in charge of the case.

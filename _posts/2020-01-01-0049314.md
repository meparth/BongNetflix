Tracy Lord is a spoiled heiress who is about to marry George Kittredge. Her ex-husband C.K. "Dex" Dexter-Haven, to whom she was married for a relatively short time, is a musician who lives next door. Tracy is meticulous about everything that she does and having her ex-husband around isn't part of her plan. Dex however would like her back.

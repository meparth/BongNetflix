Sarah Manning, a streetwise Brit by upbringing, has had a difficult life, living in foster care with a flamboyantly gay foster brother, artist Felix Dawkins, both under the care of their equally tough foster mother Siobhan Sadler, who eventually moved them all to Toronto. All single Sarah really wants is to provide a comfortable and stable life for her adolescent daughter, Kira. Sarah's life changes in an instant when she witnesses a woman who looks exactly like her commit suicide by stepping in front of a train. Witnessing that event is the first step to Sarah discovering that she was and is part of a cloning project, two of her other "sisters", suburban soccer mom Alison Hendrix and Ph.D. microbiology candidate Cosima Niehaus, along with her who collectively try to uncover the nature of the project, including who may be constantly watching them, and if there are other sisters out there about which they do not know. They will find that not all of their sisters would work toward the same goals as them, and that a parallel project has a completely different set of identicals.::Huggo

Jean (Chutimon Chuengcharoensukying) wants to convert her house into a home office and she needs to majorly declutter and reorganize her entire house. Anything that has been lying around unused, she just simply throws all. However, Jean faces a great challenge when she comes across some items that belonged to Aim (Sunny Suwanmethanont), her ex-boyfriend. Although she has no use for the items, each one reminds her of a story that brings back memories, along with unresolved feelings that cannot be easily discarded by just dumping them into the garbage bag. Jean has to decide what to do with Aim's stuff. Should she just throw everything, keep everything, or return the items to their rightful owner to clear them completely from her house and her heart?::Mwd

Albert leaves his house one morning without telling anyone where he is going. His girlfriend Stella files a complaint with the police and when he doesn't return after days, she begins to fear. What she doesn't know is that Albert is traversing a road journey from Mumbai to Goa. Nayar who drives the vehicle accompanies him on his mission. Punctuating their cynical, witty and devastating conversations, we see Albert's flashbacks of a world where he and Stella try and weave a life together. Albert's anger stems from experiences that life has presented to him. It is this anger that is taking him on a journey to settle a score and enable him to lead a life of dignity and hope.

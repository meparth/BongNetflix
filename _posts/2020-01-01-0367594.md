Dreaming of seeing the inside of the exceptional chocolatier Willy Wonka's intriguing candy factory, more than anything else, the impecunious but honest boy with a heart of gold, Charlie Bucket, yearns to get the chance to meet his idol in person. Before long, a worldwide contest organised by Willy himself will set the stage for the adventure of a lifetime, as the world's greatest chocolate-maker announces that the fortunate boy or girl who comes up with one of out of five rare golden passes hidden in his famous and scrumptious Wonka Bars, will win a free tour of the factory, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. By some miracle, Charlie, who only has enough money to buy one chocolate bar a year, finds the last fifth ticket, and, alongside with his beloved Grandpa Joe, and four other equally lucky children and their chaperones, set foot in cryptic Willy Wonka's remarkable world of chocolate. Of course, only one kid gets to win the grand prize. Can Charlie pass Wonka's final test?::Nick Riganas

With his wife and two children away for the weekend on Father's Day, the happily married suburban dad and successful architect, Evan, hears a knock at the door in the dead of night, during a violent storm. Before him, the stranded and soaking-wet friends, Genesis and Bel, ask for help and a place to stay while waiting for a taxi; however, pretty soon, things will take a dark turn for the unexpected, when the pair of tempting femmes fatales seduce Evan into bed. Now, the stage seems set for a dangerous cat-and-mouse game, as the girls have their way with the unwise Good Samaritan. Can Evan save his marriage, and, above all, his life?::Nick Riganas

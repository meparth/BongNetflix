Brutally abused, imprisoned, and traumatised since childhood, young Lucie escapes from her captors and befriends Anna: another injured soul at the orphanage. Nearly fifteen years later, convinced that she has finally found her fiendish tormentors, Lucie decimates an entire family, as horrible visions of an emaciated and deformed creature haunt her. Is this grotesque female entity real, or is she an intangible manifestation? Under those circumstances, what is the dead family's secret? As these hauntingly persistent questions demand answers, before long, Anna will learn firsthand that some horrors require transcendence before salvation. Is Anna destined to be a glorious martyr?::Nick Riganas

New to Amityville and friendless, young Belle Walker finds it difficult to make a fresh start, especially after moving with her mother, Joan, her little sister, Juliet, and her twin brother, James, into the notorious house on 112 Ocean Avenue where the 1974 DeFeo Family killings occurred. However, with James in a persistent vegetative state, things will soon get from bad to worse, as an endless string of mysterious occurrences that pivot around the ailing brother start to take place. Under those circumstances, are the hair-raising rumours real? Will the evil Amityville House let the Walkers get out alive?::Nick Riganas

Ram Mehra used to live in a shanty Chawl in Jogeshwari, Bombay, but worked hard, married Sarita, opened his own business ('Mehra Furnishings Company'), became the parent of Sidharth, and moved to a bungalow in Juhu. He and Sarita had hoped that Sidharth would be good in his studies and eventually take over the business; but, instead, Sidharth turned out to be a slacker failing his final year exams and rude to his mother. Asked to shape up, Sidharth moves out to live with his new-found friend, Aisha Banerjee, a woman fresh from Kolkata who has just landed a job with Mumbai Beats magazine (and is in love with her boss, Kabir Chaudhary). She permits Sidharth to live with her but ends up frustrated when she realizes he cannot cook nor clean up after himself and is very childish and immature. With daily arguments ensuing between the two, it will not be long before Sidharth may have to move out again - but where will Sidharth (with all doors closed in on him) move out to now?::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

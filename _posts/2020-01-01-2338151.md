PK is an Alien who visits earth to understand about its 'intelligent' inhabitants, but the very first lesson is a painful one when the remote control of his spaceship is stolen. Hence he now faces myriads of problem in a planet where he is alone unaware and can't even speak its language. But he is helped by a noble soul named Bhairon Singh and hence his search takes him from Rajasthan to Delhi. Here he learns that his remote control can only be returned to him by the heavenly intervention and from here on his tangle with the 'organized religion' starts as he tries various religious solutions but when all of them fails he not only criticizes them as a tool used by the 'managers' of religion to exploit the helpless but also seek refund and in the end redefines religion as something which is Rational , Compassionate and Humane , Not the Superstitious , Hateful, and Heartless one currently propagated to the masses which he calls as the 'Wrong Number'.::Raveesh

With his grandfather dead and mother getting too chummy with a new business partner, young Bayu finds little support at home as he captains his U-15 youth soccer team. With national pride on the line, sponsors abruptly replace his coach with a hard-nosed task master who brings in a new, taller, handsomer team member who unintentionally takes Bayu's limelight and best friend Heri. As grades slip, and forced to work with an appealing classmate, a school project becomes his only hope against repeating his grade level for another year - if only he can find the time.::statmanjeff

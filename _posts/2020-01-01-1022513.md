Five teenagers : Joke (the gang-leader), transvestite Ake, Mued the junkie, Kai the big mouth and June, insolently rob a kindergarten. During the police chase, their get-away car swerves and crashes into a small shop. The gang crawls out of the car and the shop owner is taken as a hostage. They escape into an empty train carriage. They plan to wait there for the night after which they can divide the loot and go their separate ways. Unexpectedly, all of this new train's passengers are extremely rich. Joke sees a chance to make more money by robbing the passengers. As he was about to start with the robbery, suddenly no one was there. Shockingly Joke realized that he and his friends are no longer alive and the passengers are all ghosts. It seems the ghost will be taking the passengers to their final judgment.::Anonymous

title: "Like Stars on Earth"
description: "Ishaan Awasthi is an eight-year-old child whose world is filled with wonders that no one else seems to appreciate; colours, fish, dogs and kites are just not important in the world of adults, who are much more interested in things like homework, marks and neatness. And Ishaan just cannot seem to get anything right in class. When he gets into far more trouble than his parents can handle, he is packed off to a boarding school to 'be disciplined'. Things are no different at his new school, and Ishaan has to contend with the added trauma of separation from his family..."

The Awasthi family consisting of Nandkishore, his wife, Maya and two sons, Yohan and Ishaan, all resides in a house-hold in Bombay, India. The two children attend St. Anthony's High School, while Yohan excels in his studies, Ishaan is the exact opposite; everything about him is negative with a record of failing twice in his third standard, the boy who hides his report card from his parents, the one who makes mischief with other students and his teachers all gives the principal a reason to throw him out. Even at home in his neighbor hood his behavior gets out of control when he gets into fights with other children. The numerous complaints from others forces his parents to enroll him into, "The New Era" boarding school in distant Panchgani but Ishaan's performance still does not improve and is again on the verge of being rusticated when a temporary art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh is recruited. Ram believes Ishaan is suffering from dyslexia and attempt to explain to his parents and other teachers that he will work on curing the boy.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)

Director: `Kristin Hanggi`  

Cast: `Victoria Justice` `Pierson Fode` `Matthew Daddario` `Ryan Ward` `Griffin Newman` 

Two NYU freshmen who grew up side-by-side in Greenwich Village - one a gay male, the other a straight female - are as inseparable as two best friends can be; that is, until they fall for the same boy. It is a love story that epitomizes the state of sexuality for Generation Next, but it's not about falling in love. Instead it is like 'High Fidelity' or 'Will & Grace' because the hardest part of loving someone is also learning to let go. This is a modern, coming of age story about growing up whether you like it or not.

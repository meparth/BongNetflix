Naked tells the tale of Johnny, who flees Manchester for London after sexual intercourse with a woman turns violent. In London he crashes with ex-girl friend Louise and her flat mate Sophie. Both Johnny and Sophie seduce and eventually fall for one another. Johnny though, eventually gets fed up of Sophie's clinging and obsessive actions and leaves for the streets. In the following days Johnny unwittingly encounters all sorts of undesirable and peculiar people. An abusive Scottish boyfriend and girlfriend, a security guard of an empty building, an insomniac and a lonely young waitress. Meanwhile Louise and Sophie are tormented by the landlord from hell, Sebastian, who is abusive, violent, threatening and even rapes Sophie on their first encounter. By the end of his journey Johnny is beaten by a gang of youths. He stumbles his way back to the house not only bringing with him his chaos but stumbling into the chaos brought on from Sebastian.::Luke Foster

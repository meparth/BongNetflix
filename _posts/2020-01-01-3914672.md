In the middle of the desert a stolen 4WD collides with a transport truck. The two Aboriginal kids in the car are hurt. Badly. Someone should have called for help. But they didn't. They didn't because that 'someone' works for a major stakeholder in a research project no-one talks about. The kids' accident would have remained a mystery if it weren't for Ned and Jesse Banks - a young internet journalist desperate for a break, and his brother, a hacker on a strict good behavior bond. The question is how far those in authority will go to keep their secret safe. And just how far the two brothers will go to reveal the truth.

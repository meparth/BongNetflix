Jake believes his retired grandfather is senile, concocting fanciful stories of his life as a U.S. special missions operative, but when Angie, a girl who's caught his special interest, disappears without a trace, Jake's grandfather proves all the stories true. The pair embark on a hunt for the missing Angie, along the way reuniting Grandpa with his old over-the-hill gang, known as the Devil's Scum.::statmanjeff

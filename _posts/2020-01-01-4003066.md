For the first time in Turkey a comedy actress plays a character of her own creation on screen. Deliha follows the hilarious exploits of a slightly crazy, decidedly droll and genuinely good-natured young woman in search of love. Written by Gupse Özay, who stars in the title role, the movie promises audiences laughs and adventure aplenty. Crazy Zeliha's story begins when she goes to a fortune-teller one day with her friends. The very same day, Cemal and his gorgeous-looking brother, Cemil, open a photography studio in the neighborhood and things become to get complicated.::BKM

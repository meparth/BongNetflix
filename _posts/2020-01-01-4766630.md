Young orthodox Jew Mordechai Wolkenbruch, called Motti, has a serious problem: All the women, whom his mama introduces to him as potential wives, look just like her. Fellow student Laura, however, does not, at all - but unfortunately she is a schikse. She wears pants, has a nice tuches, drinks gin and tonic, and swears. Motti begins to have doubts about the predetermined path given by his parents as the road for him to follow? His obedience towards his mother's disturbing methods starts to fade as his passion for Laura grows. Things take their course, and very soon Motti comes to a conclusion: even schiksen can be totally nuts.::Thomas Meyer/edited by statmanjeff

Against the backdrop of global unrest, shortly after the nearly supernatural events in Sherlock Holmes (2009), the keenly observant detective and artist of deduction, Sherlock Holmes, along with his loyal comrade-in-arms, Dr Watson, find themselves drawn deeper and deeper into a sinister international conspiracy. As war closes in on 1891 Europe, a faint trail of breadcrumbs leads Sherlock to the cryptic Romani fortune-teller, Madame Simza Heron, and an unexpected but diabolical adversary: the mathematical genius and long-time arch-nemesis, Professor James Moriarty. Now, before the criminal mastermind's elaborate web of murder, no one is safe; especially those close to Holmes and Watson. Can the intrepid duo prevent collateral damage? Is the world prepared for Moriarty's sinister game of shadows?::Nick Riganas

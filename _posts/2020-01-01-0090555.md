Intrigued by the near-death experience of the rugged hunter, Michael J. "Crocodile" Dundee, after a close encounter with a monstrous saltwater crocodile, the New York City reporter, Sue Charlton, travels to Australia, to meet the legend in person. There, in the dusty hamlet of Walkabout Creek and the formidable outback, dangerous situations and unforeseen romantic complications await; however, Sue already knows that nothing compares to the urban jungle of the great Big Apple. So, like a fish out of water, Mick leaves Australia for the first time in his life for Manhattan's concrete maze, where he comes face-to-face with the complexities of modern life. But, will the unpretentious bushman ever adapt to the big city?::Nick Riganas

Sent by the Vatican to shed light on Sister Victoria's unaccountable suicide, the troubled exorcist, Father Burke, and the idealistic novitiate who has yet to take her vows, Sister Irene, visit Saint Cartha's monastery, in 1952 Romania. Before long, intense encounters with the supernatural will bring the pair of unsuspecting investigators face-to-face with the true face of evil, embodied in the shape of the malevolent nun in The Conjuring 2 (2016). Undoubtedly, there's a dark secret behind the abbey's thick stone walls and an ancient dark force that craves to resurface. Will Father Burke and Sister Irene escape from the wrath of the Nun?::Nick Riganas

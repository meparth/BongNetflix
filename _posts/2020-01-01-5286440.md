Director: `Matt Askem`  

Cast: `Tim Minchin` 

Live on stage from the Bloomsbury Theatre in London, the rock'n'roll nerd is back with a two hour show to a packed house, performing material from his "So Rock" and "Dark Side" albums. Minchin takes no prisoners, taking aim at religion, psychics, astrologers and homeopaths, intelligently and hilariously highlighting the absurdity of such beliefs. His songs range from sharply critical, to lighthearted, to sweet, always with a touch of silliness and absurdity that has propelled Minchin to greater heights in the many years since this show.

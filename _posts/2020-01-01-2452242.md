description: "Nick Sax awakes on a hospital gurney. He's a hit man who used to be a cop; it's all part of the job. What's troubling Sax isn't his serious injury, but the seriously perky flying blue horse that claims it is the imaginary friend of someone who is in serious trouble. The horse's name? Happy, of course. Adapted from a Grant Morrison story..."

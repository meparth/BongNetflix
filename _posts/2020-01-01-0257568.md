This is the story of two best friends Charlie Carbone, a hair stylist in New York and Louis Booker, a down-on-the-luck musician, who both are involved with the local mob family led by Salvatore 'Sal' Maggio. After their first job attempt at delivering stolen televisions to a local warehouse was backfired by brining the heat (the NYPD), Sal, completely upset, gives Charlie and Louis one more chance at redemption. His younger employee, Frankie Lombardo, gives the guys the most important assignment: to fly to Australia and deliver the mob's $50,000 to a Mr. Smith in the exact time. And so begins a cross-content trek of mishaps including: ramming a kangaroo down on the road, flying in a bush airplane and tranquilizing the pilot, walking in the burning desert, and eventually teaming up with a wildlife expert named Jessie to chase down the kangaroo who has the the $50,000 mob money. Can Charlie, Louis, and Jessie survive the heat, get the money, and save the day without getting killed by the mob?::Christopher Howell (Ckh87520@aol.com)

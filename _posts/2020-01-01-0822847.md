In a dystopian world, the church, in control of "civilized" society within the walls they've built, had once trained priests to combat vampires. That role of the priest was revoked when the church felt that the vampire problem was no more in having confined them. When teenaged Lucy Pace is abducted, signs being that abduction carried out by vampires, her uncle, a priest (hereafter referred to solely as Priest), is determined to find her before she becomes infected. In doing so, Priest goes against the church, which refuses to reinstate his authority as a vampire battler in not believing that there is a vampire problem and which states that in going against the church is going against God. Joining Priest in searching for Lucy is Hicks, a sheriff outside the church walls, he who is in love with Lucy, and Priestess, one of Priest's old colleagues with who he has a special bond. If they are able to find who abducted Lucy, they will discover that their adversary has past ties to them. In the process, a potential problem arises in deciding what to do if they find that Lucy has already been infected, Hicks who will not allow her to die under any circumstance, while Priest is willing to kill her in she no longer being who she was, killing her despite his closer tie to her than he divulges.::Huggo

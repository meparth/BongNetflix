Deep into a swaying and lush bamboo forest, Okina, an elderly farmer, stumbles upon a mysteriously glowing bamboo stalk, that from within, a minuscule fairy-like creature enfolded in a royal robe sprouts before his amazed eyes. Without delay, the ageing man rushes to his wife, Ona, only to witness, much to their surprise, the tiny nymph transform into a baby. In the end, as the infant grows exponentially into a fine girl, the humble couple will take her to the capital, Kyoto, to make her an aristocratic and well-mannered lady worthy of Japan's most powerful suitors. But is this Princess Kaguya's fate?::Nick Riganas

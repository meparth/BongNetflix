Cast: `Kevin Costner` `Gary Oldman` `Tommy Lee Jones` `Ryan Reynolds` `Jordi Moll√†` 

Captured by a Spanish anarchist before he seals a deal with the profit-motivated hacker known only as the "Dutchman", the London-based CIA operative, Bill Pope, is killed in the line of duty. Suddenly, retrieving the memories and the invaluable information inside the brain of the dead agent become the bureau's top priority--and with the help of Dr Franks' radical procedure--his knowledge is transplanted into the troubled brain of the perfect candidate: the emotionless psychopath, Jerico Stewart. Now, as Jerico's fragmented memories become inextricably intertwined with Pope's classified information about the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile system, he becomes the target of both the CIA and the anarchists. Is a volatile criminal our last hope?::Nick Riganas

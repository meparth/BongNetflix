Director: `Jay Karas`  

Cast: `Doug Stanhope` `Andy Andrist` `Kristine Levine` 

Named after Hitler's first failed coup attempt, Beer Hall Putsch draws you deeper into the acerbic comic's clear-sighted view of the world with his newest one hour stand-up special recorded live at Dante's in Portland. In the special, Stanhope effortlessly bends a story of a half-dead boxing legend propped up by his trophy wife to sell tickets to community theater into a pognant recounting of assisting in his mother's suicide, then into a twisted NFL sex fantasy. What sets Stanhope apart, however, is that he's so hysterical and relatable that the viewer almost forgets how wrong it is. Almost.

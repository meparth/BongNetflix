Meera leaves her young son, Chhotu, to work with Bhati, who runs a Dhaba in the Rajasthani desert so that they can pay off their debt. After a few weeks, Chhotu, who now calls himself Kamal, comes to visit her along with a Caucasian woman, Lucie, and asks permission to visit Delhi. Meera is apprehensive about Lucie and does not permit her son to go anywhere with her. She subsequently comes to visit him, to see how he is making out at the Dhaba, and it is here she will face nothing but humiliation when she will be told that her son has stolen books and clothing from Kunver Ranvijay Singh, the only son of Raja Rudra Pratap Singh. When asked to apologize, Kamal not only refuses, but runs away to an unknown location - leaving Bhati to face the Raja's wrath.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

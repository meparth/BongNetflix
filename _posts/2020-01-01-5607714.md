On the outskirts of Budapest, the ageing recluse and saturnine manager of a small abattoir, Endre, is used to hiding his disabled left arm along with his emotions behind a busy schedule. Then, unexpectedly, a shy and graceful newcomer in the office catches Endre's eye: Mária, the plant's cryptic and glacially beautiful quality-control inspector. Now, against the backdrop of the cold slaughterhouse and a small theft within the company's walls, an eerie and almost spiritual bond will start to develop between the tender outcasts, as, more and more, their lives become inextricably intertwined. However, are the two dreamers, Endre and Mária, ready to embrace the catharsis of love on both body and soul?::Nick Riganas

In the Netflix family comedy series The Healing Powers of Dude, 11-year-old Noah Ferris (Jace Chapman) is struggling with a social anxiety disorder that can make the simplest everyday activities feel like he's drowning in quicksand. But after years of homeschooling, Noah bravely decides that he wants to give middle school a chance and perhaps even make some friends he's not related to. To help him navigate his new environment, his parents (Tom Everett Scott and Larisa Oleynik) get Noah a scruffy, high-energy emotional support dog called Dude (Steve Zahn). While Dude's a novice with a short attention span and a distracting obsession with treats, what he lacks in experience, he makes up for in charm, spunk and wanting the best for Noah. If this unlikely pair can find a way to overcome their differences and work together, they may just survive everything from wisecracking pre-teens to a cat-obsessed school principal and make it through the school year. Created by Sam Littenberg-Weisberg and Erica Spates (Coop and Cami Ask the World), The Healing Powers of Dude is a buddy comedy about a boy, his dog and the power of friendship that can come in any form (or breed).

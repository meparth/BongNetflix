Abandoned at a very young age, an unnamed youth faces taunts about his name and religion. He asks a priest what his name is. The priest answers "Ram Jaane" (God knows), which the youth accepts as his name. He grows up to be a career thief and criminal, and ultimately a feared gangster. He is in love with his childhood sweetheart, Bela, and believes that she too loves him. When other gangsters decide to take-over the building in which Bela lives, Ram decides to oppose them, so as to impress Bela, and get her to marry him. Ram only ends up antagonizing the gangsters and their men, and finds out that Bela dislikes him, and wants to marry another young man by the name of Murli.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

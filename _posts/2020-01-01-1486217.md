Archer is an animated, half-hour comedy that revolves around an international spy agency and the lives of its employees. Although their work of espionage, reconnaissance missions, wiretapping and undercover surveillance is daunting and dangerous, every covert operation and global crisis is actually just another excuse for the staff to undermine, sabotage and betray each other for personal gain. The series features the voices of H. Jon Benjamin as the highly skilled and incredibly vain master spy "Sterling Archer;" Aisha Tyler as Archer's fellow agent and ex-girlfriend, "Lana Kane;" Jessica Walter as Archer's domineering mother and spy agency director, "Malory Archer;" Chris Parnell as the easily intimidated comptroller-turned secret agent "Cyril Figgis;" Judy Greer as Malory's loquacious, dingbat secretary, "Cheryl;" Amber Nash as the discordant director of human resources, "Pam Poovey;" Adam Reed as the gay voice of reason, "Ray Gillette;" and Lucky Yates as the spy agency's possibly mad scientist/ possibly clone of himself, "Krieger."::Anonymous

After their mother's death, Edward Elric and his younger brother, Alphonse, try using alchemy to bring her back to life. Unfortunately they do not fully take into account the law of equivalent exchange which requires a sacrifice of equal value to what one hopes to achieve. Not only do they fail to revive their mother but Edward loses an arm and a leg and Alphonse loses his entire body, forcing his soul to remain confined to an empty suit of armor. Seeking a way to restore their bodies, Edward becomes a state alchemist and the brothers begin a long search for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, an object purported to allow its users to ignore the law of equivalent exchange.::Ashlena

Men with guns face humiliation: Jimmy's daughter wants a fancy wedding which he can't afford on his NYPD salary, so her step-father smiles and offers to pay Jimmy's share. Paul, Jimmy's partner, thinks his wife is two-timing him with a neighbor, so he hides a video camera in their bedroom. Jimmy can get money for the wedding by selling a rare baseball card, which he loses when the dealer he's selling it to is robbed. The robbery is connected to the thugs running drugs, as the partners discover when they search for the card. Will Paul be a cuckold and Jimmy upstaged at his daughter's wedding?::<jhailey@hotmail.com>

Addicted to the fast, high-octane world of the fictional, no-nonsense Los Angeles cop, Jack Slater, portrayed by his favourite idol, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the neglected eleven-year-old film fan, Danny Madigan, can't wait to see a special preview of Slater's latest movie. With the help of his projectionist friend, Nick, and Harry Houdini's magical golden ticket, young Danny will soon become part of the story, living and breathing inside a glossy celluloid world filled with high-speed car chases; magnificent explosions; surreally good-looking women; ruthless Sicilian mobsters, and murderous henchmen. However, when a small dose of reality creeps in the fantasy realm, and vice versa, the invincible Jack Slater is in for a big surprise, up against his equally indestructible arch-enemies, in a world he barely recognises. Will the last action hero live up to his reputation?::Nick Riganas

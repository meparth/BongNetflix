A doting, overly-possessive mother fresh from a mental breakdown after she was replaced on her TV talk show re-enters her son's life just as he decides to get engaged to a free spirited, multi-talented woman who works as a dog-walker and temp at a doctor's office. Immediately seeing the woman as a threat, she puts on a good face in front of her son but immediately starts plotting against her. However, two can play that game and the war is on. In the middle of the mess is the mother's assistant, who is loyal to her boss but has been with her long enough to not take any of her guff.::John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net>

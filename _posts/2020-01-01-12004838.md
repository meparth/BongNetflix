A retrospective of Schitt's Creek (2015), the little show that made it big, is presented in light of the filming of what is the sixth and final season. Father and son co-creators and stars Eugene Levy and Dan Levy talk about the dynamic between the two of them in developing the show, and along with the actors specifically of those lasting into season 6 the casting process, with Daniel further talking about the writers' meeting to map out the on-going story arcs to their conclusions over the course of a maximum of fourteen episodes of season 6. The development of the over-the-top nature of the character of Moira is presented, from her wigs to her unrecognizable accent to her unique vocabulary, with special mention made to her wardrobe being authentic designer as opposed to knock-offs of designers, a challenge within the show's budget. The importance of the show to the LGBTQ community is discussed, not only in presenting such characters in a matter-of-fact way in life as opposed to preaching about LGBTQ issues, but also the emergence of Moira as the latest gay icon. The long professional history and working relationship of Eugene Levy and 'Catherine OHara is presented. The nature of some of those major story arcs, especially the conclusions of the romances of Alexis and Ted, and David and Patrick are shown. Fans, including several celebrities, discuss their love for the show and their feelings about it ending while it is arguably reaching its apex. And the show literally being a Levy family function with Eugene's daughter/Daniel's sister Sarah Levy among the cast is presented.::Huggo

In 1989, teenager Mike O'Donnell is the star of Hayden High School's basketball team. On the day of the final game, Mike will be observed and may win a scholarship to college. However, his girlfriend Scarlet tells him that she is pregnant and Mike does not play the game. Twenty years later, Mike is a complete loser who blames Scarlet for his failures. He is not promoted to sales manager after working sixteen years at the same company; Scarlet is divorcing him; his teen-aged son Alex and daughter Maggie hate him; and he is temporarily living with his best friend, the eccentric and immature millionaire Ned Gold. Mike nostalgically visits Hayden where an old janitor talks to him about second chances in life. During the night, he sees the janitor jumping from a bridge into the river and he unsuccessfully tries to help the man. He then discovers that he is seventeen again. Further, he discovers that he has a second chance to fix his relationship with his family.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

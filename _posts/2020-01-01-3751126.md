Pran Boon, or Hunter Boon, saves a child's life by killing a young Sming that attacked him. Little did he know that the young Sming was not the only one in the area. After having witnessed Pran Boon killing her son, mother Sming sets out to Pran Boon's village, seeking revenge that leaves Pran Boon's wife dead and his daughter injured. Knowing he and his daughter would never be safe again until the Sming is dead, Pran Boon begins his hunt for the most dangerous hunter in the jungle with the support of Pran Hlong, an immigrated Chinese hunter who seems unlikely to be an ordinary hunter. As the Sming's hunt for villagers escalates, a young ranger, Chart, is sent to Pran Boon's village to investigate. Meanwhile, an English hunter, John, and his team tag along with Chart with the purpose of hunting wild animals. Along the dangerous hunt, all the different contestants will have to face different deadly situations. As the story goes on, a Cambodian hunter shines light on the origins of the Sming, now one-eye blinded by Pran Boon.::Fast Time Motion Pictures

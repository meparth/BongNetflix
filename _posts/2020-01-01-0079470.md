Cast: `Graham Chapman` `John Cleese` `Terry Gilliam` `Eric Idle` `Terry Jones` 

As the otherwise mighty Romans try to rule 33 A.D. Judea with an iron hand, Three Wise Men from the east arrive at a humble manger, intent on delivering their precious gifts to newborn Jesus Christ. Instead, they visit poor Mandy Cohen and her baby boy named Brian at their dilapidated stable, only to set in motion a series of unforeseen coincidences. As a result, thirty-three long years later, against the backdrop of a new religion, Brian has now become an active member of the subversive movement known as the "People's Front of Judea", only to find himself mistaken for the prophesied Messiah, after a botched act of extremism. Now, there's no turning back, and the cross awaits him. Can Brian prove that he was just a boy living a few stables away from Jesus?::Nick Riganas

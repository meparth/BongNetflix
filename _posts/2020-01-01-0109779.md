Alternate reality where Nazi Germany won World War II after repulsing the Allied invasion at Normandy. Now in 1964, Germany continues fighting a bitter guerilla war with the Soviet Union and desperately needs an alliance with the United States in order to finally beat Stalin's war machine. However, when S.S. homicide detective Xavier March (Rutger Hauer) begins investigating the mysterious death of a retired Nazi Party official, a cover-up is revealed involving the Jewish Holocaust of World War II. With the assistance of an American journalist, March probes deeper and discovers the full truth about what happened to the Jews; a truth that could destroy the peace process with America and a truth that Nazi and S.S. leaders will stop at nothing to keep hidden.::Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com>

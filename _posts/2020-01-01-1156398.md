With America infested with hordes of decomposing zombies from end to end, one of the few zombie-apocalypse survivors, Columbus, manages, somehow, to live to fight another day, while on his way to Ohio to check in on his family. Surrounded by mayhem and destruction, Columbus joins forces with the no-nonsense pro survivalist, Tallahassee, bent on continuing the dangerous road trip through Armageddon. However--as the band of zombie hunters is joined by the stranded girls, Wichita, and her younger sister, Little Rock--an unexpected change of plans will lead them to the last unspoilt place: the Pacific Playland amusement park in Los Angeles. Could the rumours be true, or is the odd team heading toward its demise?::Nick Riganas

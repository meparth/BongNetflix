A person with an extreme social anxiety battles his wrongful past and all the wrongful opinions people formed around him, because he wasn't able to express them. But as he is always being misunderstood and because of his condition- a battle for him could simply mean- being seen in public as himself. Being pressured by his surroundings he becomes a department's boss and the people within try to help him overcome his issues, while half of the time they are simply scared of him.::Iliyana

Director: `Luc Besson`  

Cast: `Robert De Niro` `Michelle Pfeiffer` `Dianna Agron` `John D'Leo` `Tommy Lee Jones` 

Brooklyn kingpin Giovanni Manzoni (De Niro) had it all until the day he became a snitch. Now no matter how many times Agent Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones) relocates Giovanni and his family, danger is never far behind. When they blow their cover once again, Giovanni, his wife Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer), and their two kids Warren ('John DLeo) and Belle (Dianna Agron) are shipped off to a sleepy village in France. It seems like the perfect place to escape the long arm of the lawless until the criminally inclined family resorts to their treacherous old ways, once again becoming a blip on the syndicate radar. Now the thugs are moving in, and they mean business. As the Manzonis use their unique set of skills to survive the relentless storm of bullets, bombs, and rockets, the citizens of this peaceful French village suddenly find themselves in the middle of an all-out Mafia war zone..

Off the coast of the shark-infested Cape Town, a terrible tragedy and an untimely death put a premature end to the otherwise brilliant career of the dedicated marine biologist and open-sea diver, Kate Mathieson. Now--almost one year later and with Kate's ever-growing debt to the bank threatening to put her out of business for good--the profitable proposition of her ex-boyfriend, Jeff, to take an adventurous entrepreneur on a dangerous shark dive is the only way to stay afloat. However, this is the realm of the ocean's most feared apex-predator: the great white. Is courage alone enough to stay alive?::Nick Riganas

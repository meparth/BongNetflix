Director: `Rob Reiner`  

Cast: `Jack Nicholson` `Morgan Freeman` `Sean Hayes` `Beverly Todd` `Rob Morrow` 

The quiet mechanic, Carter Chambers, has been married for forty-five years to his beloved wife Virginia and has three children. Of the two sons, one is a lawyer and the other an engineer; the daughter is a violinist. The caustic and bitter billionaire Edward Cole owns many hospitals, has been through his fair share of divorces and has one missing daughter. Following Edward's work ethics, rather than give him a private room during his stay, his hospital puts him in the same room as Carter. As time goes on the two men become close and when Edward finds Carter's 'bucket list' in the garbage, listing all he wanted to do before dying, he includes his own items on the list and invites Carter to a journey of friendship, discovery and redemption.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

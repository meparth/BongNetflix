After his actress mother Renee Hallow is electrocuted to death before his eyes on the set of a movie she was shooting, Jeff Matthews and his veterinarian father Chase decide to move from Los Angeles to Renee's hometown of Ludlow, Maine. There, Jeff befriends fellow outsider Drew Gilbert, the stepson of the town's sheriff Gus Gilbert. One night, Drew decides to bury his dog in the cursed Micmac burial ground that lies beyond the pet sematary, and Zowie comes back. Not long after, on Halloween, Zowie emerges and violently kills someone. Terrified about his death, Jeff and Drew decide to take him up to the burial ground to try and resurrect him, but all hell breaks loose. Pretty soon, Jeff starts to wonder if maybe he should use the sinister power too.::Tornado Dragon

Mumbai-based Indian Army Officer, Amaan Malik, who lives with his wife, Divya, and daughter, Binty, decides to quit, and seek employment elsewhere. He is then approached by a plainclothes police officer, Ahmad Hussain, and asked to infiltrate a gang of terrorists and bring their ringleader, Sultan, to justice. He initially refuses to do so, but subsequently changes his mind after Divya and Binty are killed in an explosion at a Ganpati Mandir. He is given a new identity, Ahmaan Yusuf Ali, and sent to prison on trumped-up charges where he must seek contact with other terrorists. He dramatically manages to do so, acquires a reputation, and gets to meet RD and his attractive sister, Iya. After considerable violence, including the well-planned execution of Goonga, he gains their confidence and plans are underfoot to finally introduce him to Sultan. But this meeting will be far from welcoming - for Sultan has already been aware that there is a traitor amongst them - and he has made plans to do away with him/her - and carry out a series of explosions in Mumbai.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

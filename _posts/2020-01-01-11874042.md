Wasati is based on true events that happened during a play in Riyadh 10 years ago. The play was called "Wasati bela Wastiah" which roughly translates to "A Moderate Without a Middle-Ground," where a group of extremists attacked the theater and the play was shut downAND attack by them and many thing happend after that . That story shook the society and it was all over the news. The film addresses that event and retells the story from a different point of view.::me

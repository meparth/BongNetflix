On the verge of retiring as Commissioner of Police, Prakash Rathod, gets a telephone call from a male who informs him that he has placed several bombs all over Mumbai, and unless and until he arranges the release of four terrorists, with Al Qaeda and Lashkar links, namely Ibhrahim Khan, Ikhlaque Khan, Mohammad Zaheer, and Khursheed Lala. This male then warns Prakash that if his demands are not carried out, the bombs will explode, and one of them has been placed right opposite the Commissioner's Colaba office. It will be now up to Prakash and the state's Chief Minister to either adhere to this male's demands or face the death of tens of thousands innocent civilians.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

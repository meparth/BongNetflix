Kath and Kim are suburban nightmares living the suburban dream. Kath is a forty-something single lady who likes to keep herself trim, and cleanses and tones of an evening. She's proud of her townhouse and considers herself high maintenance. Her daughter Kim is a pouting princess whose glass of Bailey's Irish Cream is always half empty rather than half full and believes she's a horn bag in anyone's language. She's separated from her husband of two months and is consoling herself by stuffing her face. With Kath's new fiancé Kel, Kim's second best friend Sharon, and her estranged husband Brett, they love to make mountains out of molehills and sours ears out of silk purses. Kath and Kim leave no letter unturned as they mangle syntax and find virtue in the mundane.

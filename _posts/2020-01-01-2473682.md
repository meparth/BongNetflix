In Oxnard, California, the teenager Jesse graduates high-school and buys a camera in the pawnshop. Jesse lives in an apartment on the second floor of a small residential building with his father and grandmother and in the floor below lives Anna who people used to say that is a witch. Jesse has two friends in the building, Hector and Marisol. When Anna is found dead in her apartment, the prime suspect is Jesse's schoolmate Oscar who had just left her apartment. Jesse, Hector and Marisol snoop around Anna's apartment and soon they find a sort of altar with photos of Oscar and Jesse. Then Jesse changes his behavior and soon they discover that Jesse was marked by evil witches. Will Hector and Marisol save Jesse from evil?::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Roman - a young man from the city - comes to a remote village in rural Romania to sell the land he inherited from his departed grandfather. Once there, Roman is exposed to a series of strange events, all culminating with him discovering that his grandfather used to be a local crime lord. In order to sell, Roman has to face his grandfather's -deputies-, led by Samir - an affable and charismatic Tartar. Meanwhile, Hogas, the local policeman, investigates the finding of a severed foot, but what he's really after is getting revenge at any cost on Samir, his lifetime nemesis.

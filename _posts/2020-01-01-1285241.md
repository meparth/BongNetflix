5 years ago, Don (Shahrukh Khan) succeeded in taking over the Asian underworld. He now wishes to take over the European underworld. Members of the European drug cartel wish to kill him, because he is jeopardizing their business, however they fail to do so and he kills most of them instead. Later, Don returns to Malaysia and surrenders to Malik (Om Puri) and Roma (Priyanka Chopra). Don is sentenced to jail where he meets his old rival Vardhan (Boman Irani) whom he had put in jail 5 years ago.

Also joining them in the crime are Sameer (Kunal Kapoor), a computer hacking expert and Jabbar (Nawab Shah) an assassin who was originally hired to kill Don.

Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a young shy man who works in a bank. One day, he discovers a mask by the sea, which (according to an archaeologist) pictures the Norse god of tricks and deception, Loki. When Stanley puts on the mask, he transforms into an uncontrolled reflection of himself, that does crazy things and amazes the people. This new super-hero, the "Mask", falls in love with a singer, Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) while he decides to eliminate every gangster in the city.::Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com>

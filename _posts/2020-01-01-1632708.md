Director: `Will Gluck`  

Cast: `Justin Timberlake` `Mila Kunis` `Patricia Clarkson` `Jenna Elfman` `Bryan Greenberg` 

Jamie Rellis and Dylan Harper, on opposite coasts, break up with their lovers: each separately vows to stay out of emotional entanglements. So when Jamie recruits Dylan to manage GQ's art department in New York City - and she's the only person he knows in Manhattan - they decide to become friends with sexual benefits. It works well until Jamie meets a pediatric cardiologist who just might be a match, and Dylan invites her to come home with him to Los Angeles for Thanksgiving. He may be jealous of the doctor, she may be sending new vibes in Dylan's direction, but can either see the signals? And is it inevitable that life imitates art?::<jhailey@hotmail.com>

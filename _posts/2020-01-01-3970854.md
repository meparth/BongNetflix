Mexico's President commits a serious gaffe on live television while welcoming the U.S. ambassador. His allies at the media conglomerate Television Mexicana seek to divert attention by reporting on a bribery scandal involving Governor Carmelo Vargas, who is seen caressing a briefcase full of dollars. Governor Vargas then pays millions to TV MX to improve his image and make him a suitable candidate for the presidency. TV MX lands on the kidnapping of twin girls for this purpose, and shows Vargas as a dynamic leader heading the search efforts. The film is a sardonic, (black) humorous, at times violent look at the convergence of presidential politics and a voracious media monopoly. The viewer is left to decide how much of it is fiction, and how much a true reflection of life at the top in Mexico.::Anonymous

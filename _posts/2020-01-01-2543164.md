In the clear skies of Montana, in an unprecedented worldwide incident of simultaneous first contact with extraterrestrial life forms, an ominous alien pod out of twelve in total, comes to a standstill, hovering only a few feet over the green prairies. Is this some kind of peaceful contact? Inevitably, as panic ensues, Colonel G.T. Weber recruits a team of various experts including the esteemed linguistics and dialectology Professor Dr Louise Banks and the theoretical physicist Dr Ian Donnelly, burdening them with the impossible task to decipher a coded conversation with the intergalactic visitors. But when all attempts to communicate prove fruitless, a practical, yet very important question will arise: does humanity have enough vocabulary to understand the aliens' answer before a new global war sparks?::Nick Riganas

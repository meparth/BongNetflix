The series is known for looking at then (1960's) hot topics such as sex, war, God, religion, politics, and racism and other things that make up the human condition through a lens of the future. The eighty episode television series, which was produced from 1966 to 1969, has now cult characters and has fans all over the world.::Marty McKee <mmckee@wkio.com>

The American engineer Jack Dwyer is expatriated to Southeast Asia to work in the water plant of his company. He travels with his wife Annie and their daughters Lucy and Beeze and befriends the English Hammond at the airport. Nobody from his company comes to take Jack and his family to the hotel and he accepts the ride offered by Hammond with his local friend Kenny Rogers. Soon Jack notes that the television, telephone, Internet and cellular do not work and the front desk explains that they are facing problems. On the next morning, Jack walks to the market to buy a newspaper, he discovers that there is a revolution in the country and the rebels are executing foreigners. Now his only hope is to reach the American Embassy with his family. But the rebels are everywhere and Jack does not speak or read the language of the country.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

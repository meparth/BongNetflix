Aims to establish itself as the defining film of the electronic music genre. Through an artfully crafted narrative and stunning visual techniques, the film delves into the highly popular world of electronic dance music, providing backdoor access to a widely misunderstood, self-driven and well-insulated industry on its way to global domination. The narrative leads with the legacy of Carl Cox and following with newcomer, Martin Garrix, as the film explores the parallels between Cox's undeniable influence and hand in the evolution of dance music and Garrix's formation of mainstream genres and global fame.

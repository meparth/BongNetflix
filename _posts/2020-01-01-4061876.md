About the greatest Filipino boxer of all time, Emmanuel 'Manny' Pacquiao, the film traces the young champion's humble beginnings - back when he was known with a moniker alluding to a local liquor brand. Before he became one of the world's greatest athletes, Emmanuel was a young boy living a hand-to-mouth existence trying to survive from one day to the next. When he discovers his natural talent for boxing, he embarks on a brutal and intense journey that takes him from the amateur circuits in the mountain provinces to the slums of the big city. He must risk everything to become a champion - for himself, his family, and his country.

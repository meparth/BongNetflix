In the 19th Century, the wealthy Prescott family comes to the western town of Miradeo. Unfortunately, while Jim Prescot is thrilled to be back in his childhood home to develop his railway, his daughter, Lucky, is not enthused. Stuck in a strange town with her overbearing Aunt Cora and no friends, Lucky's spirits only lift when she finds the untamable feral stallion, Spirit. Together, these two lonely souls form a bond that would see them through life's troubles and adventures that match their true potential.::Kenneth Chisholm

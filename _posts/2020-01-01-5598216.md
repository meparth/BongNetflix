Director: `Jon Greenhalgh`  

Cast: `Dan Chaid` `John du Pont` `Dave Schultz` `Mark Schultz` `Nancy Schultz` 

This documentary focuses exclusively on John du Pont, Dave Schultz and the events surrounding the rise and fall of 'Team Foxcatcher'. Full of breathtaking archival footage of Du Pont, Schultz, the team and their families filming themselves on the DuPont Training Farm or giving promotional media interviews, this film offers a unique opportunity to see what really happened. Unlike the dramatic feature Foxcatcher (2014) - which takes a lot of liberties with the facts, the events, the characters and their relationships - this documentary doesn't invent anything and tells the amazing real-life story using their own words and film footage. Dave Schultz' widow Nancy Schultz was a witness to the events and his murder and is interviewed, too.

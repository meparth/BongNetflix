Seo Jung-hoo is a mercenary who will do whatever his clients ask, except kidnapping or killing people. He is known in his field as "Healer", the best night courier in his business. He is given a mysterious mission from a client to monitor a young woman named Chae Young-sin, an online news reporter at a low-level news agency, and report everything she does. Healer applies for a job at Chae's company in disguise to accomplish the mission under a fake name. It starts like any other job for him and never does he think that he will fall for the charming news reporter as they uncover a 20-year-old murder mystery.::Alex

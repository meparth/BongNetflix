Teen Lara Jean Covey lives a normal, boring high school life until some unexpected letters get released to all her former crushes.

At school her life is thrown into turmoil when these boys start to approach her about their letters. Among these boys are Josh, who happens to be her next door neighbor and her older sister Margot's boyfriend, and Peter Kavinsky, her arch nemesis, Gen's boyfriend. Through out some very unusual events Lara Jean finds herself and maybe even a real relationship.

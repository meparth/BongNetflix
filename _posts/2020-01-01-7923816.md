Kwon Shi Hyun, Choi Soo Ji and Lee Se Joo are a collection of messy ties, all from backgrounds of privilege and wealth. Kwon Shi Hyun and Choi Soo Ji are best friends and she is the current object of his affections. Soo Ji is very possessive of Shi Hyun, who has asked her to marry him to spite their parents, who will be marrying each other soon. Seeing an opportunity for revenge against the man who snubbed her, Soo Ji makes a proposition to Shi Hyun who is an expert at seduction to the point that it's something of a hobby. If Shi Hyun can get Eun Tae Hee, the first love of a man who snubbed her and a notoriously cold-shouldered girl who thinks being swayed by love is pathetic, to fall in love with him so he can break her heart - she'll agree to marry him. Shi Hyun, wholly confident in his ability to play the game, accepts. But when these games of seduction and revenge turn into something real, everyone involved finds themselves drawn into something far more serious than they had ever anticipated.::https://mydramalist.com/26230-love-game-the-great-seduction

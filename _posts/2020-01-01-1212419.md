The story of three people who have been affected by death. French television journalist Marie Lelay (Cécile de France) is vacationing on an idyllic South Pacific island when a tsunami strikes. Washed away in the flood, she is rescued and survives, though she may have died before being revived. In London, a young lad named Marcus loses his twin brother Jason (identical twins Frankie McLaren and George McLaren), struck down by a truck, and is desperate to try and contact him. Lastly, San Franciscan George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is a genuine psychic who finds his ability a curse as a simple touch will provide him with information from the dead that loved ones so desperately desire. All three live a lonely existence, but when their paths cross, they all find closure of sorts.::garykmcd

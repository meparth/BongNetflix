The A List is set in what appears to be an idyllic island summer camp, but where dark secrets will turn the "holiday of lifetime" into a twisted nightmare. Mia thinks she's all set for a summer of sun, romance and social dominance, but the late arrival of mysterious new girl Amber disrupts everything. Amber walks into the camp like she owns it; funny, confident, glamorous and effortlessly charming. Mia instantly hates her. Slowly, Mia's former followers defect to Amber's side and Mia starts to suspect that there's much more at stake than a popularity contest...there's something in Amber's eyes. Something cold...something hungry...and when she locks her gaze to yours, you can feel it in your head, probing, cataloguing. And absorbing...Amber is not a normal girl, she has powers, they are growing and they are dangerous. The heightened tension and remote setting allow The A-List to explore universal teen concerns of friendship romance, loyalty and betrayal in an intense crucible of powerful and addictive drama.

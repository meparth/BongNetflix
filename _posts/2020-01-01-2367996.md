Though Anand's kung-fu skills are practically second to none, he is, like so many other personable but unemployed youths, deemed worthless. Once he lays eyes upon Shakthi, daughter of special investigator Gaurav, he's instantly smitten and seeks to impress her (with his method and sense of civic duty about to land him in trouble). Policeman Gaurav has been tasked to identify the ruthless gang that has made its way to yet another city, a group of martial art cutthroats that leaves no clues behind as it robs and murders well-off, elderly citizens. No one knows it's Angusamy, a.k.a. "Dragon," a kung fu master who heads this gang, whose students train in his dojo by day and moonlight as smoothly-run thieving executioners by night. In trying to get Shakthi to look upon him heroically, Anand dons a superhero costume. While amusing her along with her niece and nephew as "Mugamoodi" (The Mask), he ends up running down one of Angusamy's men for the police. As the gang tries to identify him (and pin their miseeds on him), Anand's struggle for love, justice, anonymity, appreciation and survival begins.::statmanjeff

After their parents perish in a terribly mysterious fire, Klaus, Violet and Sunny Baudelaire are sent to a very distant relative, only to find out that the relative is unbelievably evil and only after their fortune. But this was only the beginning of a large string of unfortunate events. As the Baudelaires travel around the world trying to escape the distant relative, they learn about other unknown relatives who their parents never mentioned. They learn about the secrets of their parents. What they actually used to do, what they were preparing the Baudelaires for. But it's almost as if this series of unfortunate events will never end.::abdullahmamun-38677

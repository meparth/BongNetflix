Designed to cure his young daughter Alicia's Progeria--an incurable, progressive, and fatal malady--Professor James Marcus makes a breakthrough only a few weeks after the devastating events in Resident Evil: Retribution (2012) by discovering the T-Virus: a seemingly miraculous remedy that will bring humankind to its knees within hours. Now, to retrieve the last vial of anti-virus, Alice must race the clock and break back into the ruined Umbrella Corporation Headquarters in Raccoon City, to save the remaining human survivors that are still uninfected. However, the impenetrable underground stronghold known as The Hive is riddled with the hordes of the ravenous animated dead, as Alice's megalomaniac arch-nemesis, Dr Alexander Isaacs, has a plan for immortality of his own. Is there any hope left for humanity?::Nick Riganas

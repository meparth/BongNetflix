When a prominent French politician is found dead on the border between the UK and France, detectives Karl Roebuck (Stephen Dillane) and Elise Wassermann (Clémence Poésy) are sent to investigate on behalf of their respective countries. - However, as the case takes a surreal turn, a series of elaborate killings force the French and British police into uneasy partnership. Despite cultural divides, they find common ground in the race to stop a serial killer who has no boundaries. - Using increasingly ingenious methods to highlight five 'truths' about our morally bankrupt society, the murderer draws Karl and Elise ever deeper into a powerful, personal and deadly agenda. - A compelling and sophisticated thriller set against the backdrop of Europe in crisis, from the makers of Broadchurch, Spooks and Life on Mars.::Anonymous

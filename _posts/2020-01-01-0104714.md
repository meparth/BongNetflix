But they come across a robbery and they catch one of the robbers and discover that he has in his possession armor piercing bullets. Which means that no cop is safe. They go and try to speak to the man but Lorna Cole, a cop from Internal Affairs also wants to speak to him but Riggs is obstinate, so they go to the Captain, who not only backs them up but reinstates them as detectives. But when they go to see him, they find the man dead. But the learn who the killer is, a former cop named Jack Travis. But when they learn about this Cole shuts them out. But they get a lead from Leo Getz but unfortunately he gets away. Later Murtaugh shoots a boy who is armed with an automatic weapon and becomes despondent.

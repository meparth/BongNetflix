Based on the real life tragedy in Norway 2011, where 77 people were killed in a terrorist attack by a far right extremist. We follow one of the survivors' physical and emotional struggle after the attack, as well as the trial of the terrorist. A trial that shows how Norway's legal system tries to preserve the human rights of a single perpetrator that executed the worst massacre in Norway.::Anne-Lene Myklebust Karlsen

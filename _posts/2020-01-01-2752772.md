In a farmhouse near a corn field where Ellison Oswait lived, the boy Dylan has nightmares and is visited by ghostly children led by the boy Mile. Dylan lives with his mother Courtney Collins, who has just left her abusive husband, and his brother Zach and is forced by the ghosts to go to the basement to watch home films in Super 8 of families being slaughtered. Ex-Deputy So & So is investigating the crime spree of Bughuul and burning down the houses where the deceased families lived to protect other families. He travels to the farmhouse and finds Courtney and her sons living there. He tells that he is a private investigator and he protects her against a bluff of her ex-husband to keep the children with him. Then he begins a love affair with Courtney. Meanwhile Dylan tells to the ghosts that he will not see any video again but Zach, who is the real choice of the ghosts, replaces him. When their father succeeds in getting a court order to have the custody of the children, Courtney is forced to go with the children.

As the Earth keeps depleting its limited resources and a dreadful energy crisis threatens to plunge the globe into a new dark era of destruction and turmoil, a gleam of hope lies in a small crew of scientists at the Cloverfield Station in space. Believed to produce unrestrained amounts of energy, the highly experimental Sherpard particle accelerator is a machine that could either save humanity or it could rip holes in the fabric of reality--and soon--strange occurrences due to unexplained malfunctions will give birth to shocking discoveries. Who can harness the unfathomable powers that have been unwisely released?::Nick Riganas

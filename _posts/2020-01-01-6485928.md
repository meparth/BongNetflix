Director: `Nicole Holofcener`  

Cast: `Ben Mendelsohn` `Edie Falco` `Charlie Tahan` `Connie Britton` `Elizabeth Marvel` 

Feeling trapped in the stifling, wealthy enclave of Westport, Connecticut, Anders Harris (Ben Mendelsohn) retires from his job in finance and leaves his wife (Edie Falco) in the hopes that it will renew his lust for life. However, he's quickly faced with the startling reality of his choices; he spends his days looking for things to decorate his empty shelves, sleeping with strangers and feeling terribly lost. Missing his ex-wife and on the outs with his troubled 27-year-old son (Thomas Mann), Anders befriends a drug-addicted teen (Charlie Tahan), sending him down a path of reckless and regrettable behavior. His shameful actions cause him to question who he is as a father and, ultimately, who he is as a person.

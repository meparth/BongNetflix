Leading a serene and quiet life as an employee at a Boston hardware store, the distant and cryptic former U.S. Marines operative, Robert McCall, has dedicated himself to living a silent and low-profile existence, still haunted by his ignoble past. Constantly trying to appease his inner demons, the insomniac ex-virtuoso of violence reads the classics at the local diner; however, when his platonic late-night companion--the young streetwalker, Teri--ends up in the hospital brutally abused, things are bound to get ugly. Now, this pitiless guardian angel will equalise the odds, as feral retribution rains down on everyone involved. But, when Robert's bloody ballet of death is finally over, will there be anyone left alive?::Nick Riganas

As a last resort to save their tattered marriage, Gerald and Jessie Burlingame set off on a weekend adventure at their secluded lakeside retreat, in the hope of rekindling the long-lost affection in their relationship. Everything is taken care of: the fridge is well-stocked, and there's not a soul in the area to disturb the couple, as Gerald intends on playing a harmless but kinky sex game with a pair of handcuffs and a lot of imagination. But instead, when an unforeseen situation leaves Jessie handcuffed to their sturdy wooden bed, an entirely different game will commence--one that requires perseverance, a clear mind, and above all, a strong will to survive.::Nick Riganas

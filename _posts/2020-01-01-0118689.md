Director: `Mel Smith`  

Cast: `Rowan Atkinson` `Peter MacNicol` `John Mills` `Pamela Reed` `Harris Yulin` 

Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is an eccentric caretaker working for the British National Gallery in London, England. He is going to get fired by the museum's board of directors, because he doesn't do his job and all he does is sleep. But the board instead decides to send Mr. Bean to Los Angeles, where David Langley (Peter MacNicol), curator of a museum in downtown Los Angeles has requested that the board of directors of the British national gallery sends a art scholar to talk about their latest purchase, the famous painting "Whistler's Mother" which military officer General Newton (Burt Reynolds) has donated to the museum, at a opening conference. But Mr. Bean's arrival in Los Angeles causes mayhem, as David invites Mr. Bean to stay with his family and begins causing problems for David's marriage. But Mr. Bean doesn't know anything about paintings and although they think he is a brilliant, eccentric art scholar, he really isn't the right man to protect the painting as his behavior also threatens the painting.::Daniel Williamson

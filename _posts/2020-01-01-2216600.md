Lee Eun Oh, a selfish noble's son with the ability to see ghosts, arrives at a small village controlled by a ruthless feudal lord while searching for his missing mother. There he meets Arang, the ghost of a young woman that lost all her memories upon dying. Not wishing to move on to the next life without knowing her own identity or the reason of her death, she asks Eun Oh to help her solve the mystery, even maneuvering to have him named magistrate so that he'll have the obligation to investigate. Uninterested in getting involved in other people's problems, he refuses, until he realizes Arang may be the last clue he has to find his own mother.::Dama del Puente

Cast: `Seth Rogen` `Jay Chou` `Cameron Diaz` `Tom Wilkinson` `Christoph Waltz` 

When news magnate James Reid dies, his son Britt and chauffeur Kato, resentful of Reid's slights, vandalize a graveyard statue. By chance, they also rescue a couple from thugs, but TV reports the vandalism, not the heroism. Britt, thinking he's a genius while relying on Kato's mechanical and kung-fu skills, decides to be a superhero, the Green Hornet, and use his father's paper to play up the bad-guy elements. The reporting on the Hornet upsets LA's DA, who's up for reelection, and the city's real crime boss, Chudnofsky. Plus, how long will Kato suffer in silence, when he has all the skill? Competition for the affection of Britt's assistant, Lenore, brings things to a head.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>

Indran (Vishal) is a boy suffering from Narcolepsy since childhood. It is a rare neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and he falls asleep at any point of time when he experience any extreme form of excitement or emotion. Indran has 10 specific desires in life which he wants to fulfill. He is aided by his friends (Jagan and Sundar Ramu) as he ventures forth to fulfill his life ambitions, egged on by his loving and caring mother (Saranya Ponvannan). Indran meets Meera (Lakshmi Menon) daughter of a rich business man (Jayaprakash) and her curiosity in him slowly turn into love. But her dad fears that Indran cannot lead a happy married life and will not be able to make him a grand-father. But the brave girl takes an extreme step to help her lover overcome his disorder. However fate intervenes cruelly as she is brutally gang raped in front of Indran who is on sleep-mode. Whether Indran identifies the real culprits forms the rest of the plot.::Anitha

MANTOSTAAN is a dark satire based on four burning and the most controversial short stories (Khol DO, Thanda Ghosht, Assignment and Aakhri Salute) of Legendary Urdu writer Saadat Hassan Manto. Stories are set in 1947 India-Pakistan partition time throwing a spotlight on the most inhuman side of human beings. Manto's Characters take you to a very dark satirical world where his characters grab your breath by portraying darkness yet innocence, gritty yet humorous at parts... MANTOSTAAN talks about the sufferings of common people and how the most beautiful creature called human being turns into the ugliest.::Javid Banday

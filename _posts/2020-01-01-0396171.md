Director: `Tom Tykwer`  

Cast: `Ben Whishaw` `Francesc Albiol` `Gonzalo Cunill` `Roger Salvany` `Andr√©s Herrera` 

In the squalid slums of eighteenth-century Paris, the French orphan, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, is blessed, and, at the same time, cursed with an uncannily acute sense of smell. Little by little--as the young man discovers the world and a myriad of primitive scents--one fragrance, in particular, remains frustratingly elusive: the fleeting aroma of a woman's body. Haunted by a catalytic act of violence and obsessed with capturing the female essence, Jean-Baptiste dedicates himself to the dark quest of creating the ultimate perfume; an intricate process that compels the damned alchemist to find enlightenment. Even if the answers he seeks demand sacrifice.::Nick Riganas

After a botched attempt to make a bust in a Detroit chop shop, the effectively unorthodox police officer, Axel Foley, once more, finds himself in sunny Beverly Hills, hot on the trail of an elusive gang of cold-blooded killers. There--with the aid of old friends, Serge; the recently promoted, Billy Rosewood, and his partner, Jon Flint--Axel sniffs out the criminals' hideout which is nestled right under everyone's nose: in Southern California's bustling theme park, WonderWorld. Now, all that's left to do is to convince the people and the police that the park's impeccable chief of security, Ellis DeWald, is a ruthless villain; and that the immaculate amusement park is, in reality, a graceful and impenetrable facade for a sinister operation. How hard can it be?::Nick Riganas

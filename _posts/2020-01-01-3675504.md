Not over his parents' divorce, VINCENT hasn't really found himself. Untethered to a job, or relationship, he hangs out with STEVE, his childhood best friend, and the random girl of the week, until he meets ROMA. Instantly infatuated, but stuck with JESS, Vincent introduces Roma to Steve and watches love bloom forcing him to hide his growing attraction. When Steve leaves town, Vincent and Roma hook up, admit they are in love and vow to tell Steve by the end of the day. But as the sun drops behind the Los Angeles skyline, Vincent ruminates on his parents' failed marriage, his own arrested development and the choice he must make to become a better man.

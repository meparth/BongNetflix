Director: `Ang Lee`  

Cast: `James Fleet` `Tom Wilkinson` `Harriet Walter` `Kate Winslet` `Emma Thompson` 

At wealthy Mr. Dashwood's (Tom Wilkinson's) death, his entire estate goes to son John (James Fleet), who promised to take care of the family, but his greedy wife Fanny (Harriet Walter) takes him out of generosity, so the widow gets a tiny pension, forcing her to move with three daughters to a cheap country cottage. They are warmly welcomed by the local gentry. Eldest daughter Elinor (Dame Emma Thompson), sensible and responsible, suddenly harbors romantic hopes after meeting Fanny's charming, courteous, unambitious brother Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), the only person winning her sister Margaret's (Emilie François') confidence, who dreams of a quite parish, but seems to give in to his domineering mother. Romantic, impulsive second daughter Marianne (Kate Winslet) is instantly smitten when rescued after a clumsy fall by dashing mounted doctor John Willoughby (Greg Wise), and gets coyer attention from colonial India veteran Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).::KGF Vissers

While driving through Vermont, middle-aged Chief Editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes a rabies vaccine, and the doctor releases him. Will is under stress in his job since the publishing house where he works has been bought by tough millionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer), and the employees are expecting downsizing. Will is supported by his wife Charlotte Randall (Kate Nelligan) and his colleague and assistant Stewart Swinton (James Spader). Raymond invites Will to a party at his manor and he learns that Stewart will occupy his position in the publishing house. Will also meets Raymond's rebel daughter Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). The next morning, Will Randall goes to his work and learns that he has acute senses and he feels more competitive and decided to fight for his job. But Will is becoming a wolf and his transformation completely changes his life.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

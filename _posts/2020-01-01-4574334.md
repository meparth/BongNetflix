When Will Byers suddenly goes missing, the whole town of Hawkins, Indiana, turns upside down. Many people are on the search for Will, including his mother (Joyce), his brother (Jonathan), his friends (Mike, Dustin and Lucas), the police chief (Jim Hopper) and other notable people. But one thing leads to another, creating a supernatural trail. And things get even weirder when a little girl with a shaved head comes into the story.

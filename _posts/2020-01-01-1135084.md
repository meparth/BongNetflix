In Los Angeles, Gordon Jennings leads a specially comprised gang which carries out high stakes heists, the gang comprised of A.J., John Rahway, and the Attica brothers, Jake and Jesse. Each member was so chosen for the skills he brought to the group for their heists, which have been lucrative for them to live the high life, and to which they adhere to a strict set of rules to ensure their safety. On the day of their latest heist, a bank robbery which netted them $2 million, they come under the scrutiny of LAPD Detectives Jack Welles and Eddie Hatcher, the former, a divorced father, who is a bit more intense in his focus on nabbing the bad guys no matter what it takes. The day of that bank robbery also coincides with the release from prison after five years of one of the gang's former members, Ghost, the dynamic of the gang which has the potential to be more complicated with his return, in addition to some individual emerging issues, most notably Gordon's older junkie sister, Naomi Cozier, for who he cares, checking herself out of rehab earlier than planned. Ghost comes bearing news, which he learned in prison, about the specifics concerning an armored truck which will be carrying $12 million. Despite not fully trusting Ghost who may resent having been the only one to endure prison on their behalf, Gordon, with some extra safeguards, decides that the $12 million is too big a fish for them collectively to ignore. Beyond the issues previously mentioned, what happens with the heist and Welles and Hatcher's pursuit of the gang is further affected by the entrance of the third group, from who Ghost got the information, and the police going through their own internal problems with one of their own suspected to be on the take.::Huggo

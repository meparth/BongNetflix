Eager to slow down a little bit, Louis and Rachel Creed--along with their children, Ellie, and toddler, Gage--relocate to Maine, on the outskirts of the sleepy rural town of Ludlow. With their new home being alarmingly near to a busy country road, Louis will soon learn firsthand the otherworldly power of the mist-capped burial ground beyond the strange pet cemetery in the woods, when tragedy strikes the Creed family. Now, a grief-smitten Louis has no other choice but to believe in the dark force of the old Indian necropolis' stony and sour soil; however, some boundaries are not meant to be broken. Is it true that, on the mystical hilltop, death has no power?::Nick Riganas

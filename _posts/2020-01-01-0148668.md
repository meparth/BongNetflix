Director: `Chris Bould`  

Cast: `Bill Hicks` 

Outspoken and raw, not mincing matters, Bill Hicks tells us that, just like smokers, non-smokers also die every day - with jogging instructor Jim Fixx as an example -, asks women what's so terrible about giving head, talks us through what really happened during the 1990-1991 Gulf War and how the used technology could have also been used to feed the poor of the world. He also explains why it's true drugs have done good things for us, wonders in what mood Jesus will come back to earth if he decides to come back and, near the end of the show, most passionately yells music should be played with one's heart.::Marco van Hoof <k_luifje7@hotmail.com>

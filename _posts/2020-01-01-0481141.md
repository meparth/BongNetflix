In Manhattan, the workaholic Kate is the chef of the 22 Bleecker Restaurant owned by Paula, who sent her to a therapist because she had no other interest in life but cooking and controlling her kitchen. When her only sister dies in a car accident, Kate becomes the guardian of her niece Zoe, who can not overcome the loss of her mother. Paula orders Kate to take a couple of days off to care of Zoe; when Kate returns to the work, she finds that Paula hired the sub-chef Nick without her approval. Nick explains that he is honored to work with Kate, but the jealous Kate does not trust him and believes he wants her position. When Zoe gets close to Nick and invites him to have dinner with Kate and her, she changes her feelings for Nick. But when his work is recognized by the clients of the restaurant, Kate believes she committed a mistake.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

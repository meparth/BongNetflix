In Tokyo, twelve-year-old Shô (Tom Holland), a.k.a. Shou (Ryûnosuke Kamiki), a.k.a. Shawn (David Henrie) has a heart condition and is neglected by his parents. He moves to the house of his Aunt Sadako (Phyllida Law and Keiko Takeshita), a.k.a. Aunt Jessica (Gracie Moore) and her housemaid Haru (Geraldine McEwan and Kirin Kiki), a.k.a. Hara (Carol Burnett) to wait for a heart surgery, but he is depressed with the absence of his mother. Meanwhile, fourteen-year-old teenager Arrietty (Bridget Mendler, Saoirse Ronan, and Mirai Shida) lives on the underground of Sadako/Jessica's house with her father Pod (Will Arnett, Mark Strong, and Tomokazu Miura) and her hysterical mother Homily (Amy Poehler, Olivia Colman, and Shinobu Ôtake). They are Borrowers, tiny people that collect simple things they need in the house. Shô/Shou/Shawn sees Arrietty in the garden and during the night, she participates for the first time in a harvest with her father. Arrietty accidentally drops a sugar cube in Shô/Shou/Shawn's bedroom, but the next morning, Shô/Shou/Shawn leaves the cube near a window in the basement. Arrietty's parents decide to move to another place since they have been discovered by an inhabitant of the house. But there is the menace of Haru/Hara who wants to capture the tiny people.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

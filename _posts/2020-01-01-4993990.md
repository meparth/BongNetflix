A gruesome and action-packed crime thriller. "Die Ontwaking" explores the psyche and motivations of a serial killer, Abel, owner of a small gallery specializing in African Masks and Art, who is also currently curating a collection of tattoos belonging to beautiful female victims, that will fit his Cosmic Journal theme. Ella Neser is the attractive, but inexperienced murder detective in charge of tracking down the serial killer who has been preying on the city's young women. While trying to prove herself to her more senior colleagues, she is also struggling with the break-up with her boyfriend. Abel is smart and the young detective struggles to make headway with the case. As more victims are found, an easy culprit emerges - a well to do businessman with a link to them all, distracting her from the real killer who is continuing his work. For his upcoming fiftieth birthday, Abel has a special gift in mind for himself - a new face : that of a beautiful young woman, perhaps that of a young female detective.::Die Ontwaking

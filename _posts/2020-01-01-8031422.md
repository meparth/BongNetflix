With humankind brought to its knees after the inconceivable Shark Armageddon in Sharknado 5: Global Swarming (2017), the veteran shark hunter, Fin Shepard, finds himself in need of a bigger chainsaw. Stranded in a strange far-off land, Fin comes face-to-face with the unfathomable complications of the devastating Sharkzilla, as the unsteady leaps through time of an unexpected but dear traveller have breached the space-time continuum, setting in motion the ultimate rescue mission beyond the physical reality. As a result, Fin, and a handful of battle-hardened comrades-in-arms, have to harness the miracle of time and strike at the root of evil: the original Sharknado (2013), and Mother of all shark-infused vortices. Now, to make history, Fin must first rewrite history. Is the world prepared for the dawn of a new age, and the end of the last Sharknado?::Nick Riganas

Mexico, late 70's. A swell of cartel violence rips through the border town of San Simon, where a Chinese immigrant long on the run from his past, Chiu Lee Man, has carved out a quiet existence for himself. Years ago, he took in three children orphaned by the violence and began tutoring them in the martial arts. When Chiu is murdered in a spree of cartel brutality, his now-grown warriors-in-training vow to hunt down their mentor's killers and battle for justice. The three fighters, Silencio, Isabela, and Jesus - each trained in a unique form of martial arts, must form an uneasy alliance with Brister, a no-nonsense Houston DEA agent, and Garcia, a local Mexican Cop, in order to track down and destroy the cartel that killed their mentor and father figure and has torn their home into drug-infested, bullet-ridden shreds. But things are even worse than they know. And our heroes soon discover, to their horror, the drug lord they seek to destroy has grown his power not just out of the soil of his willingness to cruelty, but from a dark supernatural force that is the corrupt lifeblood running through the beating heart of his cartel.::Rob Pereyda

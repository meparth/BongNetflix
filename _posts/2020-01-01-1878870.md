In October 2015, Nadine Franklin, a high school junior in the suburbs of Portland, confides to her school teacher Mr. Bruner that she plans to commit suicide. Nadine narrates her life so far: By age seven, differences between Nadine and her more popular older brother Darian are already obvious. Nadine has a tempestuous relationship with her overly dramatic and image conscious mother Mona who seems to favor her brother, while Nadine's father, Tom is the only immediate member she feels close to. At age 13, Nadine is buoyed by her relationships with her best friend Krista and her father. Nadine's father suffers a fatal heart attack while driving. As a result of her father's death, Nadine's life turns upside down..

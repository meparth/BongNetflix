Enroute from Atlanta to Los Angeles via plane to be on time for the birth of his first child, Peter Highman instead runs into fellow-passenger/aspiring Hollywood actor, Ethan Tremblay, and has part of his baggage switched. Just when the flight is about to take off, Peter gets into a situation, is shot and subdued by an Air Marshall. When he regains his senses he finds he is on the 'No Fly List', no money/credit card, nor identification, and is compelled to hitch a ride with Ethan. Hoping to make it in time, he is has no idea that soon he will be assaulted by a 'handicapable' Western Union employee; get in a serious accident that will result in a fracture and several stitches; be on the run from Mexican Police; suspect his wife of having an affair with his friend, Darryl, and that the child may not even be his!!::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

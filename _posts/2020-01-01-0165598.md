Back in the days of Led Zeppelin 8-tracks, TaB colas, and Farrah Fawcett posters, "That '70s Show" continues to flashback to the times where bell bottoms were the hip thing. Set in the Wisconsin suburbs, Eric Forman lives under the authority of his parents, Red and Kitty. Next door is his girlfriend/neighbor, Donna Pinciotti and her parents Bob and Midge. The rest of the gang includes Jackie, and her on again-off again boyfriend, Kelso, Hyde, a conspiracy theorist who believes Xerox will take over the world, and Fez, a foreign exchange student who is soaking up American culture like a sponge. The gang mostly likes to spend their time in Eric's basement, pondering their lives, parents, and their futures, but they get into many funny mishaps and adventures in their teenage lives.::Scott

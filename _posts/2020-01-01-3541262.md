ROARING CURRENTS tells the story of one of Korean history's most astonishing military victories by its most revered strategist, Admiral Yi Sun-shin. In 1597, the Japanese navy under Admiral Todo takes advantage of an unsuspecting Joseon state and reinvades, decimating the Joseon fleet in doing so. Despite losing his position for enraging the king, Admiral Yi is reinstated and after a brazen offensive against Todo's headquarters, leads a previously demoralized Joseon navy into the powerful and dangerous currents of the Uldulmok Strait. While the Japanese commanders jockey for power among themselves, Yi lures over 300 Japanese ships into a deadly trap where they meet their fate against only 12 battleships.::CJ Entertainment

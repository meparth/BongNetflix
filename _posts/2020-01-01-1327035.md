Cast: `Abhay Deol` `Mahie Gill` `Kalki Koechlin` `Dibyendu Bhattacharya` `Manoj Bakshi` 

Sent to a boarding school in London, for being rude and calling his parents by their first names (Sattu, Kaushalya), Chandigarh-based slacker, Dev, leaves his childhood-sweetheart, Paro, behind. He struggles to even maintain his grades, while she tops in her studies. Years later he returns home, where Satpal, his dad, hopes he will marry Paro, even though she comes from a poor family. Dev is attracted to Paro, who has many admirers, as she has blossomed into a true beauty, but humiliates her, and prefers the company of Rasika. Events will soon spiral out of control for him, after he starts taking drugs; patronizing a prostitute, Chanda; and eventually be arrested by the Police.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)
